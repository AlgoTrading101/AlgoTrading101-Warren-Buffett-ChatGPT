0,0:00:00,0:01:00,SPEAKER 2," Warren Buffett needs little introduction.  He's the godfather of modern-day investing.  For nearly 50 years,  Buffett has run Berkshire Hathaway,  which owns over 60 companies like GEICO and Dairy Queen,  plus minority stakes in Apple,  Coca-Cola and many others.  His $82.5 billion fortune makes him the third  richest person in the world,  and he's vowed to give nearly all of it away.  The Oracle of Omaha is here to talk about what shaped his investment strategy and how to master today's market.  I'm Andy Serwer.  Welcome to a special edition of Influencers from Omaha,  Nebraska.  It's my pleasure to welcome Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.  Warren, welcome. "
1,0:01:00,0:01:01,BUFFETT, Thanks for coming.
2,0:01:01,0:01:08,SPEAKER 2," So let's start off and talk about the economy a little bit.  And obviously we've been on a good long run here.   A very long run.  And yet, does that surprise you?  And what would be the signs that you would look for to see that things were winding down?"
5,0:01:16,0:02:01,BUFFETT," Well, I look at a lot of figures just in connection with our businesses.  I like to get numbers.  So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses.  But that doesn't tell me what the economy is going to do six months from now or three months from now.  It tells me what's going on now with our businesses.  And it really doesn't make any difference  in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses,  what those numbers tell me.  They're interesting,  but they're not guidance to me.  If we buy a business,  we're going to hold it forever.  So we're going to have good years,  bad years, in between years, maybe a disastrous year, some year.  And we care a lot about the price.  We do not care about the next 12 months. "
6,0:02:02,0:02:06,SPEAKER 2, But are you surprised at how long this economy has been expanding?
7,0:02:06,0:03:29,BUFFETT," I've been surprised by all kinds of things in the last 10 years about the economy.  I mean, I don't think there was  any economist I've ever read that  talked about negative interest rates for long periods of time.  I mean, if you go back and read Keynes or you  read Samuelson, you read any of them, they do not  get into a negative rate  environment.  I think now there's still $11 trillion of government debt around the world that's at  a negative rate.  So  we've never seen it before.  And we've never seen at least the conventional  wisdom on a sustained period of  long and growing deficits while the economy is getting better,  extremely low interest rates,  and really very little inflation.  So something different is happening,  but something different happens all the time.  And that's one reason economic predictions just don't enter into our decisions.  Charlie Munger, my partner, and I,  in 54 years now,  we've never made a decision based on an economic prediction.  We make business predictions about what individual businesses will do over time.  And we compare that to what we have to pay for.  But we have never said yes to something because we thought  the economy was going to do well in the next year or two years.  And we've never said no to anything because we were right in the middle of a panic even if the price was right.   All right.  So you don't pay much attention to the dismal scientists then, I guess.  Well,  I pay none in the sense of as a guideline to doing anything.  It's entertainment.  I mean, you know, it's like going to a variety show or something like that.  But  I just don't know  of any economist that  actually has  bought businesses successfully or done well in stocks.  Paul Samuelson did.  And you may know he was a big shareholder at Berkshire.  But  it's,  you know, they make guesses.  And there's so many variables.  I mean, in the hard sciences,  you know that  if an apple falls from a tree,  that it isn't going to change over the centuries because of anything or political developments or 400  other variables that go in.  But when you get into economics, there's so many variables. And the truth is you've got to expect good times and bad times  in business.  And if you were to buy an auto dealership and you're,  you know, wherever you live locally or a McDonald's franchise or anything like that,  you wouldn't try and time the purchase.  You try and make the right purchase at the right price and you want to be sure you got a good business.  But you wouldn't say I'm going to buy it because  growth this year is going to be 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent or something.  Fair enough."
12,0:04:54,0:04:57,SPEAKER 2, You have over a hundred billion dollars of cash.
13,0:04:57,0:04:58,BUFFETT, Berkshire does.
14,0:04:58,0:05:14,SPEAKER 2," Berkshire.  I don't even see how much you got.  Maybe you do.  Berkshire has over a hundred billion in cash.  And you say that you always want this company to be a fortress.  So how much cash should an ordinary investor have on a percentage basis,  do you think? "
15,0:05:14,0:05:18,BUFFETT," It depends on a personal situation.  If you're working in something where you're not a big investor,  you're not going to have a lot of cash.  If you're working in something where you're living off your paycheck from  week to week, you want to have a little cash around.  And you certainly don't want to have a credit card that's maxed out or anything like that.  But if,  you know, if your house is paid off,  if you don't have big living expenses,  you got a portfolio of decent, diversified businesses,  you  don't really need any cash. "
18,0:05:46,0:05:51,SPEAKER 2, So you can be more cash free than Berkshire is.
19,0:05:52,0:06:28,BUFFETT," Yeah.  Yeah.  I've got responsible, you know, we've got insurance claims.  We could have hurricanes that,  you know, would happen.  All kinds of things where you might have to pay out billions of dollars.  And I've got over a million people that own  shares that are counting to run the place.  So we get through periods like that.  But if I were retired, I had to  say a million dollar  portfolio stocks that was paying me 30 ,000 a year in dividends or something of the sort.  And my children had been growing,  the house was paid off and everything.  I wouldn't worry too much about having a lot of cash around. "
20,0:06:29,0:06:44,SPEAKER 2," Let's talk a little bit about Apple.  Everyone always wants to talk about Apple,  right?  It's kind of the it stock, it company.  You have a 45 billion dollar stake,  more or less.  How closely do you follow the company?  You know, people are concerned they haven't really introduced any new products. "
21,0:06:45,0:06:48,BUFFETT," Well, if you have to closely follow a company,  you shouldn't own it. "
22,0:06:48,0:06:48,SPEAKER 2," Really?   No.  I mean, if you buy a business,  if you buy a farm,  you know, you go up and look,  you know, every couple of weeks to see how far the corn is up.  And, you know, you worry too much about whether somebody says this is going to be a year of low prices because  exports are being affected or anything like that.  You know,  you buy a farm and you hold  it for, I've got one farm that I bought in the 1980s and my son runs it.  But  I've been there once,  you know, I mean, it doesn't grow faster if I go and stare at it.  You know, I can't cheer for it, you know,  more effort, more effort or something like that.  And I know there's going to be some years when prices are going to be good and some when the prices  aren't going to be good.  I know there's years when yields will be better than others.  But it's all about the farm.  And if  it just doesn't,  I don't care about economic predictions on  or anything of the sort.  I do care that over,  over the years it's well tended to in terms  of rotating crops.  And I hope yields get better,  which they generally have.  In fact,  that farm a hundred years ago would have probably produced  30 bushels,  maybe 35 bushels of corn per acre.  And  now in a good year,  you know, it'd be 200.  I mean,  we've really made progress in this country.  That's one reason commodity prices go back a couple hundred years.  They've moved so little is because we've just gotten better and better at  whether it's  cotton or whether it's corn or soybeans or all kinds of things.  And you and I have benefited from that.  And so Apple is kind of like a farm."
25,0:08:19,0:08:34,BUFFETT," Well, it's a long term investment.  And if you owned the best auto dealership in town,  the best brand and had somebody good running it,  you wouldn't drop by every day and say,  you know, how many people have come in today? "
26,0:08:35,0:08:35,SPEAKER 2," Or,  you know, I think interest rates are going up a little.  Maybe we'll slow down our sales or anything.  You  buy it knowing there's 365 days a year and you're going to own it for 20 years.  So that's 7300 days.  And, you know, they're going to things are going to be different from day to day and year to year.  You shouldn't buy it at the day to day stuff is important.  Let's switch over to talk about buybacks,  which is another hot topic these days.  And and you did a fair amount.  If you look in the annual report,  you can see that between December 13th and 24th,  it looks like you guys bought back about two hundred and thirty three million dollars worth of Berkshire,  which was right near that particular stock market bottom.  How did you know that?  What was going through your mind? "
29,0:09:21,0:09:58,BUFFETT," If I knew it,  I'd have bought a lot more than 200.  Now, that's not a big purchase for us, actually.  And now we will buy Berkshire when we have lots of excess cash.  All the needs of the business are taken care of.  We spent 14 billion dollars on property,  plant and equipment last year,  way more than depreciation.  So we take care of the needs of the business.  Then we have excess cash.  And if we find invest,  we'd love to do is find other businesses to buy.  But if our stock,  if I think the stock and my partner,  Charlie Munger, think the stock is selling  below intrinsic business value,  we will buy in stock. "
30,0:09:58,0:10:00,SPEAKER 2, So it obviously was at that point.
31,0:10:01,0:10:31,BUFFETT," Well,  we thought so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But but,  you know, what's really intriguing is when it goes down a lot.  I mean, when when you're buying dollar bills for for 60 or 70 cents,  which periodically you get a chance to do in stocks,  then, you know, assuming you've got the cash,  you don't want to ever get so that that some some surprise could really take you out in some way.  But if we've got excess cash,  we'll buy as fast as we can. "
32,0:10:31,0:10:35,SPEAKER 2," But at that point,  it would be more like a 2009 rather than just December. "
33,0:10:36,0:10:50,BUFFETT," Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But it's,  you know, if you and I own a McDonald's franchise together and it's worth a million dollars and you own 50 percent of it,  you come to me and you say I'll sell out for four hundred thousand,  you know, I'll buy out. "
34,0:10:50,0:10:55,SPEAKER 2," You say you want to buy mine.  I'd be wary of that.  But yeah, for just that reason, you should be.  Yeah. "
35,0:10:56,0:10:59,BUFFETT," But you want six hundred thousand dollars,  you'll say come back tomorrow. "
36,0:10:59,0:11:22,SPEAKER 2," So just continuing about buybacks,  Senator Schumer's and Sanders want the government to weigh in to sort of legislate when companies can do buybacks.  And then also there was a report recently about executives doing insider trading, it appears,  around the times of buyback.  So are buybacks a kind of a problem?  Well,  you'll have some people that misbehave and respect them,  any activity.  I mean, so it really wouldn't have much to do with buybacks.  I think buybacks,  the degree to which they've been part of nefarious activity,  and I've observed them for a lot of years,  are very close to zero."
38,0:11:39,0:11:39,BUFFETT," But  that just may be that there aren't enough opportunities.  But  that article did not,  I didn't follow the conclusion on it.  I mean, you're distributing money to shareholders, essentially.  You can do it by dividends.  And presumably American business should distribute money  to its owners occasionally.  And we do it through buybacks.  We've done some.  And we don't do it through dividends.  But most companies do it through having a dividend policy.  And then if they have money beyond the needs of the business,  then I think if their stock is underpriced,  then it makes nothing but sense. "
42,0:12:18,0:12:23,SPEAKER 2, Should the government tell companies  when to do it or at least mandate conditions where they can?
43,0:12:24,0:13:22,BUFFETT," Well, they do restrict you a little in terms  of if you're some general rule of the SEC,  if you're having some kind of,  this isn't quite the right word,  but manipulative activity or anything like that in the stock.  But no,  I don't think the government should decide your dividend policy.  I don't even think they  should direct your capital investments.  They can make it enticing to make certain kinds of  capital investments, which they do with  renewable energy, for example.  I mean, the government has interest in fostering certain developments in this country over time.  And they do,  there used to be a special oil depletion allowance,  you know, 50 years ago and so on.  That was more politics than it was governmental policy.  But certainly renewables are a prime example of that.  But the idea of directing whether you are entitled to return cash to  shareholders and the manner in which you do it,  I don't think really makes a lot of sense. "
44,0:13:23,0:13:33,SPEAKER 2," The 2020 election is going to be upon us before we know it.  And I know that you had some nice things to say about Mike Bloomberg,  but it appears he is not going to be running now. "
45,0:13:33,0:13:35,BUFFETT," Yeah, it's hard to win with just a billionaire vote. "
46,0:13:37,0:13:39,SPEAKER 2, You would have your vote and a few others.  That's funny.
47,0:13:40,0:13:44,BUFFETT, But I admire him enormously.  I wish he had run.  I want to be very clear on that.
48,0:13:45,0:13:57,SPEAKER 2," President Trump was a business executive.  So two questions.  Is a business executive the right kind of person to be president?  And what characteristics do you look for for a president that you would support?  Well,  I think  a business executive can be the right person.  But I don't think that because they're a business executive that you give them extra points.  And number one, I want a president that wakes up every morning and realizes that the greatest threat to a country,  which has got all kinds of things going for it,  are weapons of mass destruction.  And that we live in a world where people,  organizations,  and occasionally countries could have people that would like to wipe out a large percentage of the American people or maybe other  countries as well.  And that you now have capabilities,  which I always thought,  until recently, I classified as nuclear, chemical, and biological.  But I think you have to add cyber now.  If  you have some evil genius someplace that,  for  crazy reasons, just like  happened with anthrax back,  who knows what motivates somebody that starts sending  anthrax out in their letters.  And if you have somebody that thinks it'd be great to send a false alarm to the Russians and  to the US that the other side was launching or something of the sort,  it's a very, very dangerous world.  It's a wonderful world,  but it has dangers now that started in August  of 1945 and when Einstein said,  you know, this changes everything in the world except  how men think.  And  so I want a president that has that same filter that  all of these other things are important,  but  protecting the country and reducing the chance of successful use of weapons of mass destruction against us  is the number one job.  And I think  most of the presidents,  I've talked to a couple of them about it over the years, and I  really think that they do realize that they may get lost in the events of every day as they go along.  And then beyond that,  I want a president that  has two objectives with the economy.  One is to make sure that this marvelous goose we have keeps laying more golden eggs.  And then I want a president that also feels that if GDP is $60 ,000 per capita in the United States,  that nobody should get left behind.  We've got a market system that works marvelously in turning out more goods and services, better ones  year after year, done it all through my life.  Would you ever talk to a candidate and say, hey,  what do you think about these three things? "
51,0:16:32,0:16:53,BUFFETT," Well,  they'll tell me what I want to hear.  So I want to hear what they tell people who disagree with them on the subject.  I always like to ask a candidate.  They usually finesse me somewhere.  But I say, what are you for that the majority of your followers are against?  You know, I know you really believe in that.  And that's really the test. "
52,0:16:53,0:16:53,SPEAKER 2, But
53,0:16:54,0:16:59,BUFFETT," I'm not sure that except under some kind of sodium  peddle or something, you're going to get a great answer. "
54,0:16:59,0:17:04,SPEAKER 2, That's great.  But that's the question you ask the presidential candidates  or presidents that you would speak to.
55,0:17:04,0:17:31,BUFFETT," If  I really want to get,  and that's why Bernie Sanders was  so successful.  I mean, 90% of the people who voted for Bernie Sanders  had probably not heard of him two years earlier.  But they felt, they knew exactly what they wanted.  They felt they knew exactly what he would do.  I mean, they felt he was authentic.  And if you asked him what he was for that most people might be against,  he would tell you. "
56,0:17:32,0:17:38,SPEAKER 2, A few questions about Kraft Heinz.  Was that a mistake?
57,0:17:38,0:19:13,BUFFETT," Well, we'll find out over time.  But we did pay too much,  in my view, for Kraft.  We didn't pay too much for Heinz.  So when we started out,  it was originally a non-public  partnership between us.  But we did pay too much, in my view,  for Kraft.  And there's not much you can do about things if you pay too much.  And secondly,  there's always been a struggle between the retailer and brands.  I mean, if I've got a terribly weak brand  and I want to get into Walmart,  I'm not going to be able to do it.  I mean,  that's all for all kinds of crazy concessions.  And I want to be in Walmart if I have some sort of  consumer packaged goods.  The negotiation is way different if you have something essential versus non-essential.  Ten years ago, Costco tried to get rid of Coca-Cola.  Costco's got terrific loyalty among customers.  And their own Kirkland brand is a $39 billion brand now.  And it moved from category to category.  And they only started in 1992.  So they know brands.  But in the end,  they put Coca-Cola back in.  If it had been Royal Crown Cola,  they wouldn't have had  to put it back in.  So there's always that struggle between the brands.  And there always will be.  But the retailer's net,  it has been moving in their direction,  particularly,  I think,  because of the Amazon revolution. "
58,0:19:14,0:19:15,SPEAKER 2, First Walmart and then...
59,0:19:15,0:19:16,BUFFETT," Oh, yeah, Walmart. "
60,0:19:16,0:19:17,SPEAKER 2," Walmart,  yeah. "
61,0:19:18,0:19:49,BUFFETT," But it's been accentuated.  I think  we have a new retailing environment now.  I mean, it is like it goes from night to day,  but it moves somewhat.  And brands that people have spent  billions of dollars developing  and sponsoring TV shows or sponsoring radio shows in the old days.  Campbell's Soup was always on there with Jack Benny or something,  you know, when I was a kid.  And it was big.  And it built brands.  And people obviously like the product, too. "
62,0:19:50,0:19:50,SPEAKER 2," But  people are more willing to change.  And it's harder.  It's a  somewhat different world.  It is night and day.  I mean, you are very unlikely to keep changing brands every day.  But it really surprised me that Gillette lost position.  Men don't like to experiment much.  Women are better at experimenting.  But  if a kid,  when you were a kid,  Gillette Cavalcade of Sports was your pal and brought  you the Rose Bowl and the World Series and all that sort of thing,  you didn't...  You'd just shave with Gillette the rest of your life.  And you still do to a great degree.  But it's not exactly the same as it was  even five years ago or so when we bought Kraft.  You mentioned Amazon as a game changer.  And I have to ask you,  you haven't bought the stock.  You're an admirer of Jeff Bezos.  A listing of the richest people in America came out.  He's number one.  I think your friend Bill Gates is number two.  You're number three.  So you can see what he's done in myriad ways.  And of course, the question is,  how come you haven't bought Amazon?  Is there still time to buy?  Would you still buy? "
67,0:21:01,0:21:59,BUFFETT," I always admired Jeff.  I mean, I met him 20 years ago or so.  And  I thought he was something special.  But I didn't realize you could go from books to what's happened there.  I mean, he had a vision and executed it in an incredible way.  Something that...  But there's a lot of games I miss.  I would have missed Microsoft even if I'd gotten to know Bill earlier.  Those just aren't my games.  I don't worry about the things I miss that are outside my circle of competence  of evaluating.  I have missed things that are within my circle.  And that's a terrible mistake.  Those are my biggest mistakes.  You haven't seen them.  But I don't...  It's not a mistake because I miss Netscape or something like that at all.  I would say that maybe 5% of the companies or 10% of the companies at most are within an area of my circle of competence.  There's something I should be able to understand. "
68,0:22:01,0:22:16,SPEAKER 2," All right.  Well, let me switch gears then and ask you about leverage a little bit.  And  corporate debt people are concerned about.  People are concerned about federal debt at $22 trillion.  Should we reduce,  let's just say, the federal debt?  And how would we do that? "
69,0:22:16,0:22:59,BUFFETT," Well,  if you're running a deficit getting close to 5%  when things are really good,  that's a new world.  And neither the Republicans or Democrats are particularly concerned about it.  And we're not having a lot of inflation.  That wasn't supposed to happen.  But it's happening.  That's why I say you don't really...  You don't want to get hung up on  trying to make an economic analysis because  nobody's any good at...  You don't get rich doing that.  If you look at...  I mentioned that Forbes list.  If you get on the list,  the number of people who have  done that by economic analysis,  I think, are just about as old as Sean there. "
70,0:23:00,0:23:11,SPEAKER 2," Okay.  Fair enough.  Income inequality, wealth inequality, you've talked about the earned income tax credit.  Is there more to it than that?  Should we adjust tax policy?  It seems to be going the other way right now. "
71,0:23:11,0:25:42,BUFFETT," Well, it is going the other way.  But I think the earned income tax credit  is the best way to put money in the pockets of people that  don't fit well into the market system,  but that are perfectly decent citizens and that  have made a good bit of the success somebody like I've had with Berkshire or something  possible.  It wouldn't have happened without the America we have.  And if you go back 200  years  and we're all working on...  80% of us are working on farms.  The person that's the best at that,  working on that farm,  whatever it may be,  is worth maybe twice the ones that's the worst.  I mean, that's the difference between super talent and no talent in the farm economy,  picking cotton or whatever it may be.  Now,  if you're the best  middleweight fighter in the world,  you may get 20 or 30 million dollars.  And if you are just a good citizen,  raise nice kids,  help in the neighborhood and everything else,  but you don't have market-related skills,  you'd be good on that farm still.  And you would be earning something  comparable to most of the people around you.  But you don't have something now that as it gets more  and more specialized, and it's going to continue to get more specialized,  you want two things for that person.  You want them to have a decent life.  I mean, they live in a country with  60,000 of GDP per person.  You want them to have a decent life, and they can.  I also think you want them to have a feeling of accomplishment.  So you want them to have a job,  assuming that they're not handicapped in some way.  You want them to have a job.  But the minimum wage would be one way,  say, well, we'll make sure that they have enough money in their pocket.  But  that's got a lot of effects in disturbing the market system.  They just need more cash.  They don't need a higher wage,  they need more cash in their pocket.  And the government at  a relatively low cost  can provide a decent living for anybody that's working 40 hours  a week and has a couple of children.  And  we've gone in that direction,  and it's sort of bipartisan.  I mean, I find both Republicans and Democrats for it.  I think it would be better not to  have one annual payment,  you know, that they get it monthly.  And I think there's various  things you could do.  But you want it.  You want them to feel part of the system,  and you want to get them,  have them get as  more and more of these golden eggs are laid,  you want them to get  a little more of their share. "
72,0:25:42,0:25:54,SPEAKER 2," I mean, if we don't do that and the Democrats win,  it's possible we get,  you know,  big taxes on wealthy people,  free college for all.  And those are bigger plans. "
73,0:25:54,0:26:47,BUFFETT," You want more money in the pockets of everybody that's willing to work  or is unable to work.  And we can do it.  A rich family would do that.  You know,  if I had six or seven kids and I  had some business I wanted to pass on,  you'd pick the most able person to run it,  because that's the market system to do that.  But you'd make sure that all seven of the family participated.  You'd give more to the one that didn't.  You might give more to the one that  kept producing the golden eggs.  You would.  But  you wouldn't just say to the one at the lowest end,  who might be the best kid of all in most respects, you know,  he's the one that shares with everybody  and does all kinds of things.  You wouldn't say to that  emperor that, you know, too bad, but that's just the way the market system works, you know.  Go have your spouse get a  job and look for housing someplace. "
74,0:26:48,0:26:57,SPEAKER 2," Right.  Why don't we do an update about the health care initiative,  which now the company has a name.  Yeah.  Haven.  Was that your idea?  No. "
75,0:26:58,0:28:55,BUFFETT," No.  Sometimes you...  No, I didn't worry about a name.  We could have gone on  as a no-name operation for 10 years as far as I'm concerned.  No,  that is...  We've got a wonderful partnership in the sense  that it's large and has  reasonable market muscle with more than a million employees  among the three of us.  We've got three CEOs that can make things get done in organizations that are so big that normally they wouldn't get very bureaucratic.  I mean,  if you try to do this with many big companies,  you'd have  legal weighing in and public relations weighing in.  We don't have any of that stuff.  They may have them in certain areas,  but I don't have to...  But Jamie isn't going to worry about doing that sort of thing.  And neither is Jeff.  So we've got a unity of commitment and an ability to execute on the commitment.  The only problem is you've got a $3.4 trillion industry,  which is as much as the federal government raises every year.  That basically feels pretty good about the system.  As we went around talking to people to find a leader for the group,  for example, everybody says  the system...  It turns out very good medicine,  but you can't go from 5% of GDP to 18 without really making you less competitive,  among other things in the world.  So everybody thought the system needed some adjustment,  just not their part of the system.  And that's very human.  I'd do the same thing,  I'm sure, if I was in the same place.  So there's an enormous resistance to change,  while a similar acknowledgement that change  will be needed.  And of course,  if the private sector doesn't supply that  over a period of time,  people will say, then  we give up, we've got to turn this over to government,  which will probably be even worse. "
76,0:28:56,0:29:00,SPEAKER 2," How often do you talk to Jamie and Jeff about it?  I know Todd Combs,  I think, is your point person. "
77,0:29:00,0:29:08,BUFFETT," Todd really does all the work at our...  If this works, give Todd 100% of the credit  from the Berkshire standpoint. "
78,0:29:08,0:29:12,SPEAKER 2, Does Haven have to buy companies to gain expertise?  What do you...
79,0:29:12,0:29:14,BUFFETT," No,  I don't think... "
80,0:29:14,0:29:15,SPEAKER 2," What is the plan?   The plan is to support  a very, very, very good thinker on this subject who is a practicing  physician and who commands the respect  of the medical community to,  in effect,  figure out some way so that we can  deliver even better care and have  people feel better about their  care too.  I mean, they have to perceive that they're receiving better care over time and  stop the march upward of cost relative to the country's output.  We've got this  incredible economic machine,  but we shouldn't  be spending 18%  when other countries are doing something  pretty comparable in terms of  doctors per capita, hospital beds per capita.  The very top stuff in medicine, I think, is  very much concentrated in this country, and that's great.  I want us to be the top leader,  but I just don't...  I think we're paying a price.  If we're paying seven extra points  of GDP,  that's 1.4 trillion a year.  Is the administration focusing...  By focusing on drug prices, is that  sort of a rabbit hole?  Is that missing the bigger picture?  Well, I don't... "
85,0:30:37,0:31:17,BUFFETT," I mean, they're trying.  Congress generally...  I mean, you talk to the average congressman.  They regard it as a problem,  and they see specific instances  of drug prices or something like that,  but it's a big problem to change.  I mean, the trouble is it intersects  in so many ways,  and that's why we've got Kewande heading it,  and we've got three bigger  size organizations backing him.  We're not trying to do it to make money.  I mean, that is not a goal that we end up with some business that  we make money off of. "
86,0:31:17,0:31:19,SPEAKER 2," Will he be talking to health insurers, for instance? "
87,0:31:20,0:31:39,BUFFETT," Well, he'll be talking to everybody,  but it is...  His game plan is not something we're  going to try and lay out because it's in his head to some degree.  I mean, obviously, we selected him by hearing and reading and so on what he's done,  but he'll learn as we go.  We will conduct certain experiments, or he will,  and try out a community where one of us has a lot of employees maybe,  and there's various ways to experiment. "
90,0:31:53,0:32:00,SPEAKER 2," Shifting gears,  where do you find things like that Abe Lincoln tail and leg quotes?  I mean, do you read Bartlett's book of quotations? "
91,0:32:00,0:32:07,BUFFETT," No, I don't read Bartlett's...  Probably 50 years ago,  I looked at a few Bartlett's quotations,  but I read a lot. "
92,0:32:07,0:32:10,SPEAKER 2, You just remember these things and apply them?
93,0:32:10,0:32:22,BUFFETT," Well, if you're 88 years old,  you ought to remember something.  You don't remember what  happened yesterday, but you remember the old stuff.  You've  got a lot of interesting quotations in your head. "
94,0:32:23,0:32:31,SPEAKER 2," You do, not like you do.  That's great.  Okay.  So one company you invested in was GE,  and you did well with that investment.  Yeah. "
95,0:32:32,0:33:00,BUFFETT," I was too early,  actually.  If you look back,  I was very active in the last half of  September and early October,  and then I wrote that article in later October.  I knew it was  going to get bad.  I wrote the article it was going to get bad,  but I didn't think the stock market  would react as much as it did between then and March.  So I had more or less used  up our powder well before the bottom was hit. "
96,0:33:01,0:33:13,SPEAKER 2," That's interesting.  How have you avoided not getting back into GE more recently?  I mean, I'm sure that they've reached out to you.  Everyone says, oh, why doesn't Warren Buffett  invest in GE and save it and take it to the promised land?  It's this great American company. "
97,0:33:14,0:33:17,BUFFETT," Well, actually, I think Larry actually is doing a good job. "
98,0:33:18,0:33:18,SPEAKER 2, Larry Kolb.
99,0:33:18,0:33:50,BUFFETT," Danaher.  Yeah, Larry Kolb at Danaher is  a good sale, and I think his priorities are straight,  and I think he's a very able guy,  and he's on the right track.  I'm a fan of GE's in the sense that  we're a big buyer from them.  We're a big seller to them.  I've known the managers.  Jack Welch is a very good friend of mine.  We don't agree on politics 100%,  but we have a lot  of fun together, and I love the guy.  So I've got a great desire for GE to do well.  It just hasn't looked that attractive to me. "
100,0:33:51,0:34:00,SPEAKER 2," Right.  You talked about the groves of trees  in the letters, shareholder.  One was the third grove,  which was sort of the in-between stakes. "
101,0:34:01,0:34:02,BUFFETT," Yeah, the equity interests. "
102,0:34:02,0:34:09,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Is it the case that those are sort of  not the healthiest grove of trees?  No.  And why would that be?
103,0:34:09,0:34:32,BUFFETT," No, those are the pilot flying Jaysbury.  No, they're companies that under GAAP accounting,  we have to record under an equity method.  We own more than 20%,  but we don't control them.  And so it's treated under GAAP accounting as a special category,  and it didn't fit well  in the other groves,  so I had to make it a separate grove by itself.  It's not that significant a grove. "
104,0:34:33,0:34:37,SPEAKER 2, You say that the sum of Berkshire has a greater valuation than the parts.
105,0:34:37,0:34:38,BUFFETT, That is true.
106,0:34:38,0:34:40,SPEAKER 2, Did you ever try to calculate that?  How much is that?
107,0:34:40,0:35:20,BUFFETT," Well, it depends on circumstances.  I mean, there's sometimes when the float from insurance  can be very valuable.  There's sometimes when the ability to use production tax credits,  we'll say, in the utility business,  but have them on our,  as part of our consolidated return helps.  But  that varies a lot.  But it is a plus.  And we can move capital.  Well, take a business like Seed's Candy,  which we bought 40-odd years ago.  It's a wonderful little business.  It throws off capital.  We've tried 50 different ways to expand geographically,  do all kinds of things.  It doesn't work.  And we'll try it again,  and it won't work. "
108,0:35:20,0:35:20,SPEAKER 2," But  we can move that capital to help buy BNSF Railroad or do all kinds of other things.  So we've got a seamless and tax-efficient way of moving capital where it's needed.  And we've got some companies that really chew up capital,  and we've got others that kick it off.  And we can move it from one part.  If you try to do that with your investments,  you incur some taxes as you go along doing it.  And it's less efficient than what we've got.  You talked a lot about the tax cuts and the benefits to Berkshire.  You didn't really get into the costs of the tax cut,  which surprised me a little bit.  What are the, are there costs?  I mean, is it just free money?  Well,  it makes a difference.  The tax cut we get,  for example, our utilities, as I mentioned in the report,  that goes to the customers.  That's just the nature of utility regulation.  But net,  we were a significant beneficiary from the tax cut.  I mean,  basically,  let's just say we had one class of stock.  We've got two.  But we have stock.  You and I own a business  together,  and we think we own all the stock.  But the truth is,  before the tax cut,  the government had a 35%  share of the stock  on income.  Now, it didn't have a share of the assets,  but it had a share of the income.  And if it wanted to change it to 40,  it could have changed it.  But fortunately, it changed it to 21.  And if we had a private business,  if we had a McDonald's franchise together,  an auto dealership together,  the third shareholder, that invisible shareholder, the governor,  just  handed us back a bunch of the shares of stock.  And our shareholders benefited,  and a lot of other shareholders benefited.  Right, you talked about Ajit Jain and Greg Abel  saying that Berkshire blood flows through their veins.  Have they made a difference since they become vice chairs?  And then, are they like Warren and Charlie? "
113,0:37:22,0:38:12,BUFFETT," No, they don't have the interaction.  They each run a separate  business.  Ajit does not think about the other businesses.  He thinks about the insurance business.  And Greg does not think about the insurance business at all.  And I think about the money and the capital and so on.  But they're running two very big businesses.  I mean, Ajit's business has,  you get all told,  at least a couple hundred billion of assets.  And Greg's business  has 150 billion of revenues.  I mean, these are,  they both would fit up there toward the top 10 or so in the country in  terms of value.  So maybe the top 15.  But they're very big businesses. "
114,0:38:13,0:38:15,SPEAKER 2," But they're not exactly like you two guys.  It's not.  Oh, no, no.   Charlie and I have a partnership thinking about the whole place,  and we've done it forever.  And we still do.  And Todd and Ted?  I didn't see them mentioned."
117,0:38:24,0:39:16,BUFFETT," Well, they have $13 billion each, including pension funds,  our pension funds,  that  they run.  And so of the $173 billion we had at year end in  equities,  they had,  well, we had $173, but we had another $8 billion in pension funds.  So of the $180 or so,  they had $26 between them that they're managing.  And they got total discretion on that.  They don't ask me.  At the month end,  I look and see what they did.  They don't do much.  They don't do a lot of trading or anything.  But I look to see what changes they made.  And Todd, for example, I mean,  he made a couple of  small investments in  private placement type operations.  And I know what the business is doing,  but I can't tell you their names. "
118,0:39:16,0:39:16,SPEAKER 2," You know,  that's his baby.  Was one of those,  you made this investment in Oracle,  and then you sold it.  Was that something they did? "
121,0:39:24,0:39:26,BUFFETT," No, that was not something they did.  That was something I did. "
122,0:39:26,0:39:29,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and you said you didn't understand it.  That's why you sold it.  But then why'd you get it in the first place? "
123,0:39:30,0:39:41,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, that's a good question,  to which I do not have a good answer.  I know.  I see development.  I know enough about the cloud to know I don't  know enough about the cloud. "
124,0:39:42,0:39:52,SPEAKER 2," Right.  OK.  So Barclays put out a note.  They said they were lowering the estimates for Berkshire,  for the EPS.  Do you read that stuff? "
125,0:39:53,0:40:48,BUFFETT," No.  Well, I mean, I may read it accidentally,  but I don't seek it out to read.  I'll put it that way.  But it just doesn't make any difference  at all.  I mean, if I spent time reading that,  I wouldn't have a time to read 10Ks.  And  we're not going to do anything different.  I don't know what we're going to earn.  As I put in the annual report,  and I really think this is unique.  I mean, we do not  prepare financial statements monthly for Berkshire.  And  there's just no other company would do it.  There's no sense doing it.  I know where the money is.  I know how the companies are doing generally.  But what difference does it make?  Because I'm not going to try and hit any number for the quarter by,  you know, having a sale on insurance or doing something even worse.  So it,  and Charlie, I mean, he knows where we stand.  And we know what businesses are doing well,  which aren't.  And we certainly know where the money is. "
126,0:40:48,0:41:01,SPEAKER 2," Another one, UBS survey of Berkshire investors says the five most important things to them are succession,  investment performance, M&A opportunity, share repurchase,  insurance margins.  Do you read that? "
127,0:41:02,0:41:06,BUFFETT," No, but I don't disagree.  I mean, I'm glad that somebody understands this. "
128,0:41:07,0:41:08,SPEAKER 2, Your own investors.  Yeah.
129,0:41:09,0:43:23,BUFFETT," Well, that's important.  You know, 54.  Well, if you go back to when I started my partnership in 1956 that  Berkshire came out of,  there were seven people sitting there at a table having dinner,  relatives primarily.  And I said, here's the partnership agreement.  It's done under Nebraska law.  It's four or five pages.  You don't need to read it.  But I said, here's a little half page,  what I call the ground rules.  And I want you to read these.  And if you feel okay about that,  about the interaction, what the expectations are and all of that sort of thing,  then we'll join forces.  And if you don't,  it's fine.  Other people have, you know, but we don't, we shouldn't be partners.  I mean,  you know, if I'm going to have a partnership with somebody,  I want it to be compatible.  It is, you know, and when you have a  public company, you can't control it.  I can't control who comes in.  I can't control some guy that comes in and thinks we were going to pay big dividends  or split the stock or something like that.  So by my actions and my communications and everything,  I want to attract the people that  from the public market that I want,  and I want to keep the others away.  Costco was built,  Sol Price, who started the Price Club and that thing.  He sat down and figured out the customer he didn't want.  And he set up a system that would keep away the customer he didn't want.  Who did he not want?  He didn't want somebody buying a quart of milk with somebody behind him with a basket of $200 worth of goods waiting for that.  So he put in a membership fee,  and by putting in a membership fee,  he killed all the drop-in business,  the business that belonged to the 7-Eleven.  We want Berkshire to keep out people who have expectations about us that are different than ours.  I mean,  good for them, and I hope they find somebody they fit.  But if you're going to run a church,  you want your seats to be filled by people that are  generally want to listen to your form of religion.  And you don't want it to change every week and say,  gee, I need a new group,  and I'll go out and talk to a bunch of investors and get them to come to my church this Sunday.  Because there's only so many seats in the church.  There's a million six hundred and forty-five thousand or so  A-equivalent shares, and those are the seats.  And I want them occupied by people that are on the same page I am. "
130,0:43:23,0:43:34,SPEAKER 2," The church of Berkshire.  Seems like you've got a big weighting in financials,  and of course you finally invested in Jamie Dimon's company.  Why banks right now? "
131,0:43:35,0:43:59,BUFFETT," They're businesses I understand,  and I like the price at which they're selling relative  to their future prospects.  I think ten years from now that they'll be worth more money,  and I feel there's a very high probability I'm right.  And I don't think they'll turn out to be the best investments at all.  You know, the whole panoply of things you could do,  but I'm pretty sure that they won't disappoint me. "
132,0:44:00,0:44:03,SPEAKER 2, Is climate change changing your insurance businesses?
133,0:44:03,0:44:05,BUFFETT," No, it doesn't change the insurance business. "
134,0:44:05,0:44:08,SPEAKER 2, Does it change  modeling or something in the business?
135,0:44:08,0:45:42,BUFFETT," No, it would change our insurance business if we were writing 20-year policies.  I mean, if there was something that changed life mortality adversely to the interests  of a life insurance company,  you're stuck with a policy for 20 years if you write the  life insurance policy, and you'll keep paying your premiums if it's adverse to me.  That's what's happened in long-term care insurance,  for example.  But when you write a policy for  one year at a time,  you see what the developments are.  And if,  you know,  cars, for example,  are much safer to drive than they used to be.  There used to be 15 deaths per 100 million miles driven.  Now there's a little over one.  On the other hand,  they've become much more expensive to fix.  I mean, that little side view mirror,  which used to cost 10 bucks,  you know, now a thousand bucks or something like that.  So you have things that are changing in terms of,  if you're writing collision insurance,  you've got to allow for the fact that the windshield,  the bumper, all kinds of things,  or the side view mirror and all that are way more expensive.  But if you're writing liability,  you know that people aren't going to die as often.  So climate change is like, climate's been changing.  But the  truth is that you now can buy really big catastrophe limits  cheaper than you could buy them in 2005 or thereabouts,  allowing for changes in the dollar and concentration of population. "
136,0:45:42,0:45:42,SPEAKER 2," So,  so far, rates have come down.  That's the reason we've gotten out of  the cat business to a great degree.  We were a very big writer of cat business  10 or 12 years ago.  We aren't out of the cat business because of climate change.  We're out because the prices aren't right.  And the world will change.  And that's got very serious consequences.  But it won't change that much from year to year.  That,  you know, we've done very well during a period of  some climate change.  You've talked about technology advancing faster than our ability to understand it.  And I'm wondering if  social media and Facebook and Google and  Russian trolls coming in,  is that maybe an example of that?  Are you still worried about that problem?   Well, I think cyber poses real risks to humanity.  Forgetting about the problem of even misinformation.  I'm just thinking of,  you know, we have railroads running over 22 ,000 miles of track and some of them are carrying ammonia and some of them are carrying,  you know, chlorine and things.  We have to carry them.  We have no choice about that.  We're required by law to carry them.  And, you know, I would rather do that in a non-cyber world than a cyber world.  There are all kinds of things.  The problem about something like cyber is that it's moving and it's just unpredictable  whether you'll get some crazy guy like,  stuck the anthrax in the,  you know, what they can do becomes magnified.  I mean, when you saw what,  you know, 19 guys did, you know,  on 9-11.  I mean,  tools in the hands or potentially in the hands  of either crazy individuals,  crazy groups, or even a few crazy governments, you know, are really something.  And we don't necessarily know what  all the tools they have are.  And that is moving all the time.  I mean, you know,  again, Einstein said, he said, I know not with what  weapons World War III will be fought,  but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.  You know, I mean, it's  a dangerous world.  I don't know if you've been following this,  Warren, but what do you think of Elon Musk's  behavior as a CEO? "
143,0:48:08,0:48:10,BUFFETT," Well, I think it has room for improvement. "
144,0:48:11,0:48:12,SPEAKER 2," Now,  he,  he, and he would say the same thing.  I mean, it's just some people have  a talent for interesting quotes and others,  others have a little bit more of a blocker up there that says this can get me in a problem.  And,  but he's,  he's a remarkable guy,  but I don't see,  I just don't see the necessity  to communicate.  You know, I've never,  I think I've got seven tweets because a friend of  mine signed me up for it and she's called me about a hundred times,  say, can I tweet this or that?  And I said yes to her seven times,  I guess, or something like that.  I've never actually written one myself.  I don't even know how to do it.  Have you talked to Elon ever? "
147,0:49:01,0:49:13,BUFFETT," He joined the giving pledge.  So once or twice,  but that's a lot of years ago,  you know, seven or eight years ago.  I'm not,  he hasn't come to our annual gatherings,  so I haven't seen  him for seven or eight years. "
148,0:49:14,0:49:28,SPEAKER 2," So let's talk about this,  this trade war that's been going on a little bit with China.  And I guess I'd like to ask you,  do you think that Donald Trump was right in calling out  the Chinese government and basically putting them on notice? "
149,0:49:28,0:50:04,BUFFETT," I won't have any comment on,  on, on, on that.  In  terms of political activity,  I don't put my citizenship in a blind,  blind trust.  So when the election comes around,  I'll, I'll do something.  On the other hand,  people will interpret things I say about any,  any president,  you know, as to some extent coming from Berkshire  and they, and they don't come from Berkshire.  I'm just an individual.  So I,  I, I, you know, I think I'm glad to talk about China,  but I can't, I can't talk to you about that part of it. "
150,0:50:04,0:50:10,SPEAKER 2," Fair enough.  I mean, do you think there was  room for improvement then in terms of the trade relationship between China and the United   States?  Well, I think that  China and the United States  absolutely are destined to be the superpowers, you know,  beyond my great-grandchildren lives.  And we'll always  have, be competitors and we'll be competitors in business,  we'll be competitors in ideas,  all kinds of ways.  And  there's no other way it would be.  And we just have to make sure that that  competition doesn't  get,  get us to a point where we don't realize that the best world is one in which both the United States and China prosper.  I mean, we do not want to have an island of prosperity in the rest of the world,  envious of us  in a, in a nuclear age.  And, and China doesn't,  Russia doesn't, I mean, we all recognize the dangers of letting  competition get out of control and, and, and become,  you can, you can be competitors without being enemies.  And, and that's,  that's what  all powerful nations have to realize over  time.  I mean, it's different than 200 years ago when you could have  some dominant country and then they may have done some things that you didn't like,  but it didn't threaten the existence of the world.  You really threaten the existence of the world as we know it.  If  important countries do not constantly recognize that they can compete,  they can fight over  certain things, but they can't regard it as  essentially the equivalent of war.  Here's a question from Kevin Chen,  who is a Berkshire shareholder and an NYU professor.  And he says, and this is sort of along the lines of what you were just saying,  Warren, but do you think that U.S.  and China will be able to resolve their differences or are conflicts unavoidable? "
155,0:52:04,0:52:48,BUFFETT," Well, I don't think conflicts are unavoidable, but I think,  I think  it has to be  active thinking on the part of  every hugely powerful country.  And Russia is hugely powerful.  I mean, 90% of the nuclear arms in the world are between U.S.  and Russia.  So they, they have to recognize that  the best world for them is one where they don't try and grab all the apples basically.  And we have to recognize that.  And, and we can't,  in the United States,  we can't think that either our ideas run the world,  you know, or we started getting aggressive about things  and China can't think that Russia can't think that.   And,  and that's obvious.  You just have to make things,  you got to be sure things don't escalate.  You know, you have World War I,  you know, with an Archduke, you know, I mean, you get,  you get these,  you can get chance incidents and you really want to,  I asked one of the presidents one time,  you know, in terms of what he would do if awakened in the middle of the night with  somebody coming to him and saying,  absolutely,  you know, somebody else had launched,  you know,  would you launch on that?  And you've got  10 minutes to decide.  I wouldn't want to have that responsibility,  but, but you want to make sure you don't get to that point."
158,0:53:29,0:53:37,SPEAKER 2," Right, right.  Would you ever make a big acquisition in China?  And if not, aren't you missing a huge  portion of the world? "
159,0:53:37,0:53:39,BUFFETT," Yeah, the answer is we would.  Yeah, we would. "
160,0:53:39,0:53:40,SPEAKER 2, Have you looked?
161,0:53:41,0:53:44,BUFFETT," We've been made aware of some things, yeah. "
162,0:53:45,0:53:52,SPEAKER 2," Are you concerned on the flip side of the coin?  Are you concerned that the rule of law is different,  that the accounting might be opaque? "
163,0:53:53,0:54:57,BUFFETT," Well,  I'd want to be sure I understood the accounting,  obviously, some businesses that'd be easier to do than others, but,  but  I know the laws,  the customs,  the accounting,  the people better in the United States than any place else.  So there's some small hurdle in,  in many countries to get over,  which I can get over.  I mean, but I, but I just don't,  it's just not as easy as looking at something where I already know the answer,  you know, from previous transactions or something of the sort.  So,  so it, it's easier to make a big acquisition in the United States.  I have to do more work  if I'm looking beyond the borders,  but I love the idea of doing it.  When we made the acquisition in Israel a dozen years ago,  you know, I didn't know what the tax  rates were there.  I didn't, I didn't know what corporate law,  you know, I was,  I, I suspected that it would all be answered satisfactorily,  which it was, but  I didn't just automatically know it. "
164,0:54:58,0:55:03,SPEAKER 2," It seems like you're more open about doing a deal in China than in previous conversations.   I don't think so.  No, I,  no,  I, I'm open.  Yeah. "
169,0:55:11,0:55:18,BUFFETT," We made,  you know, we made  two decent sized stock acquisitions there and they worked out fine. "
170,0:55:18,0:55:18,SPEAKER 2, Those are?
171,0:55:19,0:55:20,BUFFETT," Well, Petro China and BYD. "
172,0:55:20,0:55:21,SPEAKER 2," BYD, yes. "
173,0:55:21,0:55:24,BUFFETT," Yeah, BYD was Charlie's, but Charlie's very well-versed on China. "
174,0:55:25,0:55:35,SPEAKER 2," Right.  Yeah.  The, the trade, the U.S.  trade deficit has been widening and of course a lot of that  has to do with our trade with  China.  Is that something that worries you? "
175,0:55:36,0:56:53,BUFFETT," Well, I wrote an article about it for Fortune and the trade situation many years ago when,  when our deficit got to be  large in relation to GDP.  I don't think it's,  I don't think it's essential to have a trade balance,  but I, I think that if a trade deficit gets large  and, and it looks like you have no way out from it,  that that can be a real problem over time.  I mean, you're, you know, you're, you're shipping little pieces of paper to the rest of the world and they're shipping you goods.  I mean, people are working, making underwear or shoes someplace and they get little pieces of paper from us.  And it gets very tempting if you've done that enough to make sure that those little pieces of paper aren't worth very much over time when they want to cash them for something.  So you don't want to have,  we don't have any problem running trade deficits,  but, but if we ran really large ones and we sort of worked ourselves into a box where they were,  we didn't really have a solution to get the numbers down,  it could be a problem.  And I wrote about it one time,  but it's, it's kind of a nice thing actually.  Just, I mean, wouldn't you like to have something where you just send out little pieces of paper and somebody keep supplying you with their food or your,  you know, whatever. "
176,0:56:53,0:56:54,SPEAKER 2, I'm living it.
177,0:56:54,0:56:55,BUFFETT, You're all right.   Exactly.  And we call them credit cards in the United States.
180,0:56:57,0:57:15,SPEAKER 2," Exactly.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  And last question,  China's facing its slowest growth in nearly three decades.  The leadership there lower the targets,  I think to around 6.5%, 6%.  Are you concerned about this slowing growth and the impact on global markets?  Well,  I don't worry about in terms of global markets.  I mean, China's going to grow a lot over time.  I mean, they,  when you think of what's happened,  oh, this is 1949 or where, you know, but  there's been nothing really like it.  I mean, you had 20% of the  world's population at that time, perhaps,  really hadn't remotely achieved their potential.  I mean, the intellectual capacity, they had  decent soil, all kinds of things.  I mean, and, and, and,  and what's happened there almost is beyond belief and, and  that game's not over, but we've had  incredible developments in the United States.  I mean, you know,  real GDP per capita is six times  what it was the day I was born in the United States,  six times.  And we thought we were  a pretty developed country then and everything.  No, my parents wouldn't have believed it.  I mean, they, they would have thought,  you know, that this  kid has really got it made,  you know, I was born in the United States and it was true.  I mean, we had this tailwind  and, and China's had a hurricane behind it,  you know, in the, in recent decades.  In a good way. "
183,0:58:28,0:58:29,BUFFETT, Absolutely.
184,0:58:29,0:58:32,SPEAKER 2, Because you were comparing it to the tailwind of the hurricane at your back.
185,0:58:32,0:59:16,BUFFETT," Yeah, at their back.  And, and, and they've,  they have found a way of life that is dramatically different  than existed for the billion,  there was a billion then,  maybe, maybe a billion, two or three, whatever it is now.  And, and  they have changed  a  country really of size  that's, I don't think there's ever been anything like it.  We've done it too,  but it took, it took, it took so much longer.  I mean, it was more stretched out.  It was a remarkable period, but,  but  you know, when you go to,  I first went there in 1995 and then they regarded  it as a miracle.  And then I went back 10 years later,  it was a whole different country beyond that. "
186,0:59:17,0:59:23,SPEAKER 2," Warren Buffett, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Andy Serwer.  You've been watching Influencers.  We'll see you next time. "
