0,0:00:00,0:00:34,SPEAKER 1," We are here in Omaha,  Nebraska this morning with Warren Buffett,  the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.  He's just released his 55th annual shareholder letter to the shareholders over this weekend.  And this is actually the 13th year that we are now in Omaha talking to him after that letter.  This is a show that we call Ask Warren so that people can write in their own questions to Mr.  Buffett after they've read that shareholder's letter.  But obviously this morning,  given the news, there are a lot of other questions that people have concerning the stock market.  Let's jump right into it with Mr.  Buffett, who is here with us right now.  And Warren, thank you for being here today.  It's good to see you. "
1,0:00:34,0:00:35,BUFFETT, Thanks for having me.
2,0:00:35,0:00:54,SPEAKER 1," I want to talk about the letter.  Obviously, one of the things that you touch on in the letter is when people should be buying stocks.  We're going to dig into a lot of it.  But when you're looking at the futures down about 818 points this morning,  I think probably the first thing viewers want to hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus,  if this is a reason to panic and if you are worried about this.  Well,  I don't know I have any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus.  The very first day I bought stocks was March 12th, 1941,  40, 40, 42.  And the stocks were down about 2 percent that day,  as it turned out.  Unfortunately, I bought in the morning.  So when I came home in the evening and my dad told me the execution price,  it was down 2 percent. And I said, I'm not worried about that."
5,0:01:17,0:01:30,BUFFETT," If you're buying a business,  and that's what stocks are, businesses,  in fact, people will be better off if they  say I bought a business today,  not a stock today,  because that gives you a different perspective on it.   Then  presumably you're going to buy a farm,  if you buy an apartment house, if you buy a business,  you're going to own it for 10 or 20 or 30 years.  And the real question is,  has the 10-year or 20-year  outlook for American businesses changed in the  last 24 hours or 48 hours?  And we're going to  you'll notice many of the businesses we own, partially own,  American Express, we've owned it for 20 years,  Coca-Cola, we've owned it for 40 years.  Those are businesses.  And you don't buy or sell your business based on on on today's  headlines.  And if it gives you a chance to buy something that you like and you can buy it  even cheaper, then it's your good luck, basically.  Although there are a lot of people who look at the market and they say,  look, I want to buy,  but I don't want to buy when the market's sitting at new highs,  when it's been hitting new records every day.  Maybe it's off 800 points this morning,  but maybe there's more of a decline to come because the effect of the coronavirus is going to be an impact on the global economy.  IMF said that over the weekend.  You are going to see weakness as not only China,  but other countries try and address this.  You're right.  It may not change things over the five or 10 year span of things.  But if I think that I can buy something for potentially 10 percent cheaper,  maybe more than that,  if I wait a week or a month,  maybe that's what I'm sitting around.  Well, if you think that,  then you've got to you're going to get fabulously rich if you're right.  All you have to do is just keep buying at 10 day intervals and keep taking your 10 day prediction.  If I knew what the market was going to do,  obviously."
11,0:02:59,0:03:11,SPEAKER 1," But you don't I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.  I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.  Everybody, when they buy a stock,  if you're going to buy,  say, General Motors,  it has a billion,  four hundred million shares out.  You should be able to take a yellow pad like you have there.  And on one page, say, let's say it's selling for 30.  It isn't selling that low,  but that'd be 42 billion.  You should say I am buying the General Motors company for 42 billion dollars because.  And you should get it on a piece of paper.  And then if you want to have a shepherd piece of paper,  since I think I know what the stock market is going to do,  so I know whether it will be higher or lower.  But you don't  you don't have that.  But if I worry that the economy is going to slow down,  not just for the quarter,  but for the year,  that would impact how many cars I think they may be able to sell or even produce. "
19,0:03:50,0:05:20,BUFFETT," I'll guarantee cars are going to slow down someday.  They in 1932, General Motors  had 19000 dealers.  That's more than all the auto dealers in the United States today.  There are only one hundred and twenty five million people,  but they had 19000 dealers.  They produced  or sold.  And there was one month,  I think, when they sold less than a tenth of a car,  right at a tenth of a car per dealer.  That was a terrific time to buy General Motors.  And forget about the market.  If you can predict the market,  you don't read balance sheets.  You don't need to read anything.  You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper.  That is for sure.  And you really can't.  You certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.  But you're buying businesses.  And if you plan to buy a local service station yesterday and it was closing day,  I don't think you'd tear your hair out or anything like that.  You'd have already looked at where it was located and the contract that they had with the suppliers and made a decision on competition.  People,  because they can make decisions every second in stocks,  whereas they can't with farms,  they think an investment in stocks is different than an investment in a business or an investment in a farm or investment in an apartment house.  But it isn't.  If you get your money's worth in terms of future earning power over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years,  you're going to have made a good investment.  And you can't pick them from day to day.  If you can do that, you can. "
20,0:05:21,0:05:21,SPEAKER 1," Well,  I haven't met anybody yet that  knows how to do it.  You made a point of that in the letter this year where you highlighted a book that was written by Edgar Lawrence Smith back in 1924.  And you said until he came along,  nobody really realized the compound interest effect of buying stocks,  not just buying businesses,  but buying stocks themselves. "
23,0:05:43,0:05:52,BUFFETT," Edgar Lawrence Smith changed the world with that book.  And the people have forgotten all about it now,  although in the 1920s it became more and more gospel as the boom went on. "
24,0:05:52,0:05:52,SPEAKER 1," But  Edgar Lawrence Smith  set out to write a book on bonds versus stocks.  And he said he went in with the idea that bonds would be a better investment in times of deflation and stocks would be a better investment in times of inflation.  And the first line of his book was to say that he'd been wrong,  but he had enough sense to look at his evidence.  I think Darwin said,  if you found evidence that was contrary to what you already believed,  write it down in 30 minutes or your mind will just block it out.  People have a great resistance to new evidence.  And he said, if a stock yields 4%,  the bond yields 4%,  which was what he was talking about then,  the stock was going to outperform the bonds because there were retained earnings that were building beyond that yield. And that has been true for a long,  long time, but nobody paid any attention to it.  We don't get rich on our dividends that we receive,  although we're happy to receive them.  We get rich on  the fact that the retained earnings are used to build new earning power,  repurchase  shares, which increases your ownership in the company.  And Berkshire has retained earnings ever since we started.  That's the only reason Berkshire is worth a lot more,  is we retain earnings.  That led Keynes to actually say that this was an important book.  People paid attention to it,  but you're right.  It added to the frenzy that built up to 1929. "
29,0:07:18,0:08:25,BUFFETT," Well, that is true because  you can get,  my old boss, Ben Graham, told me very early on,  you get more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea,  because the good idea works.  I mean, it's a good idea to buy a home,  for example, and then  people go crazy.  The good idea works and it works and it works.  Stocks work out better than bonds most of the time.  And after a while,  people forget that there were some other limiting conditions.  With Edgar Lawrence Smith's book,  it was that when bonds yield the same as stocks,  which was the case then,  that stocks are going to outperform because they have this retained  earnings.  So stocks started going up in the 20s and all of a sudden they were selling at five  or six times the prices as when he bought the book.  And the original correct  perception on his part  had experienced changing conditions.  But people just looked.  They got their confirmation through the stock prices.  And that's what happens in bull markets.  People start out thinking stocks are cheap and then they start thinking stocks have gone up.  And a stock can be a good buy or a bad buy.  A bond can be a good buy or bad buy.  It depends on price. "
30,0:08:26,0:08:44,SPEAKER 1," But that leads us to today.  I mean, if his premise was that stocks are always going to be a better investment than bonds,  that's kind of what you hear today,  which we've been hearing for a while is,  Tina, there is no alternative,  right?  You have to buy stocks because bond yields are so low,  because interest rates are so low.  Well,  if you look at the present situation,  we've talked about this before,  that you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.  That doesn't have to be the case.  I mean, but it's usually been the case in America,  very usually in the case.  And if you buy a 30 year bond today with a yield 2 percent,  you're paying 50 times earnings for an investment where the earnings can't go up for 30 years.  Now, if somebody said, I want to sell you a stock that's at 50 times earnings,  the earnings can't go up for 30 years,  you'd say that doesn't sound very good.  But stocks are way better than 30 year bonds.  I mean, that's clear.  And that's one of the  alternatives people have.  People really have  three basic alternatives, short term cash, which is an option of doing something later on,  long term bonds or long term stocks.  And stocks are cheaper than bonds.  Charlie said recently, Charlie Munger, the vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway,  had his Daily Journal meeting just a couple of weeks ago.  And at that meeting,  he said that there's  a lot of wretched excess out there and that there's a lot of trouble coming as a result.  Do you agree with that? "
33,0:09:51,0:10:10,BUFFETT," There's always trouble coming.  Yeah, there was trouble coming in 1942 when I bought that first stock,  all kinds of trouble.  Philippines were going to fall pretty soon.  There's all kinds of trouble in 1949.  There was trouble,  certainly trouble in 2008  when I wrote an article for The New York Times.  I said trouble is coming.  But I said buy stocks. "
34,0:10:11,0:10:15,SPEAKER 1," Would you repeat that this time?  If trouble's coming, would you still say buy stocks right now? "
35,0:10:15,0:10:17,BUFFETT, I would say buy stocks if you get enough for your money.
36,0:10:19,0:10:20,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, we buy a few stocks, but we don't look at we're not buying the stock market.  We're saying I am buying,  let's say, American Express.  We own American Express.  There's eight hundred and fifteen million shares out and sells it.  This morning is one hundred and twenty six or something like that.  So it's selling for roughly one hundred billion dollars.  Now, the real question is whether the company is worth more or less than one hundred billion.  It isn't what the stock is going to do tomorrow or next week or next month.  You said just a few minutes ago when we asked you on Worldwide Exchange right now,  Berkshire Hathaway is a net buyer of stocks.  You are in a net buying position. "
41,0:10:55,0:11:29,BUFFETT," We've been a net buyer of stocks.  Or I've actually been a personal net buyer of stocks  ever since I was 11 every year.  There's been 15 American presidents in my lifetime,  more than a third.  I've lived under a third of them.  Well, I didn't buy stocks under Hoover.  I was only about six months old then.  But but there have been seven Republicans after that and seven Democrats.  I bought stocks under every one of them.  Now, I haven't bought stocks every day.  There have been a few times I've thought stocks were were really quite high.  And  I've even written an article once or twice,  but that's very seldom. "
42,0:11:29,0:11:36,SPEAKER 1," But you wrapped up your partnership at one point.  I wrapped up my partnership once because I thought it was too expensive.  Yeah.  OK, but this is not a time like that. "
43,0:11:38,0:11:46,BUFFETT," We own two hundred and forty billion dollars worth of stocks.  Now, we look at that as two hundred and forty billion dollars worth of businesses  that we own parts of. "
44,0:11:46,0:11:46,SPEAKER 1, But
45,0:11:47,0:11:48,BUFFETT, I love owning those businesses.
46,0:11:49,0:11:52,SPEAKER 1, You've also got more than one hundred and twenty five billion dollars in cash sitting around.
47,0:11:52,0:11:54,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, we'd like to buy more businesses. "
48,0:11:54,0:12:09,SPEAKER 1," We are here,  Warren, with you at Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters building.  This is upstairs in the room that's called the Cloud Room.  And this is a room where you often take students to kind of talk to them about questions they have when they come to visit you.  You also do some other things up here, too.  Other presentations. "
49,0:12:10,0:12:40,BUFFETT," Yeah, I had students there for dozens of years and  for many years, 40 schools would come in.  They'd come in groups of eight  at five days.  I spent a year and they come from all over the world.  We have them from Peru.  We have them from China.  We had from Israel.  And we had a good time, obviously.  I guess I've given it up now.  I but I I started teaching when I was 21 and I when I got to about 88,  I thought I'd take a rest. "
50,0:12:40,0:13:12,SPEAKER 1," Well, there are a lot of questions that are coming in from viewers that have been hitting here today.  They're waking up this morning looking at the stock market indicated down by almost 800 points for the Dow.  We're actually off our worst levels of the morning,  which is something to say when you're still looking at the Dow down by about seven hundred and eighty six points.  But people have a lot of questions about the economy.  They're wondering what's happening right now,  particularly with the coronavirus out there.  You have a lot of economic data at your fingertips because not only are the many businesses that Berkshire owns,  but the businesses you own pieces in.  What are you seeing right now around the globe? "
51,0:13:12,0:14:31,BUFFETT," Well, it affects various businesses.  I'm I would I would say that I received commentary.  I get some commentary monthly with from from almost all of the companies and a good many of them had some comment about how it was affecting them.  And however, it was affecting them at that time.  I'm sure it's accentuated,  but they've been affected by they were affected by tariffs.  They're affected by taxes.  They're affected by the most thing is they're affected by competitors in supply and demand over time.  And I don't have the faintest idea what our businesses will be doing six months from now or 12 months from now.  I do think that not only our businesses,  but American business generally,  we're doing fabulously better 30 years from now or 20 years from now.  And the the long term is very,  in my view, is very easy to predict in the general way,  but an important way.  I don't think there's any way to predict what the stock market will do 10 minutes from now,  10 days from now or 10 months from now.  So I work on what I think I'm able to do and as desirable as it might be to know what was going to happen 10 minutes from now.  That's just not something I'll ever be able to master.  So fortunately,  I can come to a pretty firm conclusion that  20 or 30 years from now,  America business and probably over the world will be far better than it is now. "
52,0:14:31,0:14:36,SPEAKER 1, What are the momentary implications that you've seen from coronavirus?  What's an example of a business?
53,0:14:36,0:14:50,BUFFETT," Well, an example, for example, we have maybe a thousand Dairy Queen  franchises in  China here and they're just treat only.  So they're the old  older type, not with food. "
56,0:15:10,0:15:10,SPEAKER 1,"But  a great number of them are closed.  But the ones that were open weren't doing any business to speak of.  And and Apple is I mean,  our much bigger holding is Apple.  We own five point six percent of Apple.  And and the company came out and said that it's affecting not only its stores,  but all kinds of things, supply chain. And"
57,0:15:11,0:15:16,BUFFETT, I find that certain of our companies have got supply chain arrangements that are being affected by this that I didn't even know had those.
58,0:15:16,0:15:17,SPEAKER 1, Like what?
59,0:15:18,0:15:44,BUFFETT," Well, I got one from Johns Manville the other day,  for example.  You wouldn't normally think of them as having a big supply chain,  but shore carpets or you name it.  I'll guarantee you that a very significant percentage of our business is one layer affected,  but they're being affected by a lot of other things, too.  And the real question is, is  where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years?  They'll have ups and downs.  Our candy business is a wonderful business,  but it loses money seven months out of the year. "
60,0:15:44,0:15:44,SPEAKER 1," But  the nice thing is Christmas comes every year.  When you look at the economy and how things were kind of chugging along,  let's say beginning of this year,  when first things things first picked up,  how would you gauge the U.S.  economy? "
63,0:15:56,0:16:44,BUFFETT," Well, it's it's strong, but a little softer than it was six months ago.  But that's over a broad range of it.  You look at car loadings,  rail car loadings, that's moving goods around.  And there again, that was affected by the tariffs,  too, because people front ended purchases,  all kinds of things.  There's always a lot of variables.  But the business is down and and but it's down from a very good level.  So I would say that looking at our 70 businesses and that actually they represent hundreds.  In addition,  they're a little softer.  On the other hand,  I was out with the  fellows from the Nebraska Furniture Mart just Saturday night and their business was up quite a bit in February.  But that's because weather was good.  So you have a lot of variables that hit. "
64,0:16:45,0:16:54,SPEAKER 1," Why do you think business was down,  let's say, the last six months?  Is that a decline in confidence or is it coming off of levels where there was unusual activity ahead of that? "
65,0:16:55,0:17:31,BUFFETT," Well, it isn't really down.  It's just leveled off and a little softer maybe now.  But well, tariffs,  the tariff situation was a big question mark for all kinds of companies and still is to some degree.  But that that was front and center for a while.  Now, coronavirus is front and center.  Something else will be front and center six months from now and a year from now and two years from now.  Real question is, is where are these businesses going to be five and ten and 20 years from now?  Some of them will do sensationally.  Some of them will disappear.  And overall, I think America will do very well.  You know,  it has since 1776. "
66,0:17:31,0:17:34,SPEAKER 1, But you still watch things like rail carloads very closely.
67,0:17:34,0:17:54,BUFFETT," I watch everything.  But I don't do it to make  specific investment decisions.  But I enjoy it.  I mean, I want to know what's going on.  But I also don't think that I can make money by predicting what's going to go on next week or next month.  I do think I can make money by predicting what's going to happen in 10 years.   All right.  Well, tell us more about what's going on,  just since you like knowing about those things.  Well,  as I say, you know,  the the.  Certain businesses depend on weather to quite an extent in retail,  for example, in given months.  But the big trends you see are going on,  I mean, in terms of the movement to online commerce and I mean,  the big stuff keeps moving.  But we've got a big investment airline  business and I just heard,  you know, even more flights are canceled and all that.  But flights are canceled for weather.  So happens in this case,  they're going to be canceled for longer because of coronavirus. "
72,0:18:34,0:18:34,SPEAKER 1," But  if you own airlines for 10 or 20 years,  you're going to have some ups and downs in current business and some of the weather related.  And they can be all kinds of things.  The real question is,  is, you know, how many passengers are they going to be carrying 10 years from now and 15 years from now?  And what will margins be?  And what will the competitive position be?  And but I still look at the figures all the time.  I'll admit that you you mentioned the airlines and you own stakes in all the major airlines,  not as much as Delta.  I think you own north of 11 percent of Delta at this point.  Well, right. "
75,0:19:10,0:19:28,BUFFETT, We are the largest position is in Delta.  Three of the four positions are mine.  One of the positions is one of the other fellows of the four positions.  But we own a very roughly close to 10 percent of of the four largest airlines.
76,0:19:28,0:19:39,SPEAKER 1," There's been a lot of speculation.  In fact, some of the questions that came in over this weekend were questions about those airlines,  wondering if you would buy any of them outright.  Have you considered buying any of those companies?   It'd be very unlikely we would do that.  I'm not saying it's impossible,  but it's complicated.  Why? "
81,0:19:47,0:20:20,BUFFETT," Well, for one thing, they're regulated and there's an interplay.  I'll just give you an example,  not that we'd be doing, but with Delta,  we own 18 percent of American Express and American Express is a bank holding company and bank holding companies have limits as to what they can do.  And we're a passive holder of a bank holding company with American Express.  But if we owned an airline that was tied up with them,  they'd have lots of arrangements.  There's there's there's a lot of complications because it's a regulated industry.  Anytime you get in a regulated industry,  you have more complications  and in transactions. "
82,0:20:21,0:20:26,SPEAKER 1," So is it fair to say you like these stocks and you would own more if it wasn't complicated?  Well,  we if to go beyond 15 percent in any company,  we would have to go in on hard Scott  Rodino.  I mean, there's a lot of rules as you increase your ownership.  Obviously,  almost anything we own,  we'd like to own more of.  Are you buying more of any of those stakes right now?  Apple, right. "
87,0:20:46,0:20:50,BUFFETT, I get pretty close mouth when it comes to what we're buying.
88,0:20:51,0:20:53,SPEAKER 1, I thought about that for a second.
89,0:20:53,0:21:18,BUFFETT," My jaws lock up.  But it's fair to say that anything that we own,  we like, you know, and  there's very few stocks  that we own.  And I look at them as part ownerships and businesses.  There's very few that are selling at some price where I would sell them a little higher. "
90,0:21:19,0:21:34,SPEAKER 1," All right.  Well, let me ask a question that came from Tony Dickinson.  He said in the fourth quarter,  Berkshire sold 55 million shares of Wells Fargo.  Should shareholders view this as a lack of confidence in the new CEO turnaround planned?  And what is Warren's future outlook for Wells Fargo? "
91,0:21:34,0:21:55,BUFFETT," Yeah, well,  I won't give him any advice specifically on Wells Fargo,  but it's absolutely true that  we've sold down our position.  Some of it was sold down to avoid being over 10 percent,  because then you do have some  filings with the Fed and so on.  But we have more than that.  Yeah, we've sold.  We've sold well more than that. "
92,0:21:55,0:21:58,SPEAKER 1," I think eight point four percent was the last.  Yeah,  that sounds right.  And we've we've sold.  We sold Wells Fargo in the fourth quarter and we sold earlier.  Can I ask why?  Only because I did get a number of questions.  I know.   Well, I can understand that.  But the we just don't we don't want to give any advice on what we're doing because I could change what I'm doing tomorrow.  So we we talk about everything except we don't give stock advice.  OK,  I'll try one more from Dickinson just because I think I got 15 or 20 different questions on this.  Berkshire owns thirty two point five eight billion of Bank of America and seventeen point three nine billion of Wells Fargo.  One position's been increasing while the other's been decreasing.  Does Warren like Bank of America twice as much as Wells Fargo?  And how should shareholders see the holdings?  Yeah, well, I think they've seen that we bought  we bought Bank of America and we sold some Wells Fargo.  All right.  Let me ask you a broader question that comes in just on interest rates and the impact that that might have as well.  Veroon Jane writes in on Facebook.  Hi, I'm a huge fan and a student of Mr.  Buffett.  Please ask him what impact does the zero interest rate environment across places like Japan and Europe have on their banks,  whether the business is still good and does the prolonged low interest rate regime in the United States hurt the prospects of American banks  like J.P.  Morgan, et cetera?  And in such circumstances,  do Indian banks, which have high return on equity,  look attractive to Mr.  Buffett? "
99,0:23:24,0:23:51,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, I can't comment on that.  But generally speaking,  with a lot of but  there are a lot  of other variables, too.  But the banks are going to make more money if there's if there  are higher rates with a with a steeper curve.  The curve makes  is more important.  In other words, the 10 year versus  short term rates  may make more difference than the absolute level. "
100,0:23:51,0:23:51,SPEAKER 1, But
101,0:23:51,0:24:14,BUFFETT," American banks have made very good money with very low interest rates around the world.  If you look in the UK or Europe or Japan,  even lower rates have made it pretty tough for banks.  The returns on equity are not as high and they have to use more leverage  to even get the same returns.  And I don't like that as well. "
102,0:24:15,0:24:24,SPEAKER 1," If you are talking about the curve that we're looking at this morning,  the five year, two year is inverted.  Two year ten is not right now,  but the 10 years below one point four  percent this morning.  And think of the 10 year at one point four percent.  That means you're paying 70 times earnings for for something that can't increase its earnings for 10 years.  Now, somebody somebody can do with a stock and said, you know, we this is a terrific  stock.  It sells at 70 times earnings.  The earnings can't go up for 10 years.  You'd say, well, explain that to me again.  Right.  But  no, the interest that we've never seen a situation like this in the world.  Literally.  I mean, you can go back and read Keynes and you can read Adam Smith and you can read,  you know, all the great ones.  And they don't talk about negative interest rate.  It never cost their might.  How much supply and demand all these marginal costs.  But brilliant economists never really anticipated that you would have negative.  And you've got 13 trillion or something like that worldwide at negative interest rates.  And we don't know what that means.  And we've got a lot of people who speculate what it means.  But 10 years from now or 15 years from now,  we'll look back and say,  well, it's obvious what we have under that.  And we'll we'll see it.  But it is not a normal situation.  And it's it's well,  interest rates are the basis of all value.  I mean, you know, that if if you knew interest rates were going to be zero for a hundred years,  you would think 1 percent was a great rate of return.  But you also would know if you bought something was yielding 1 percent or  that was what it paid and rates went to 8 percent,  you'd lose practically all your capital.  So it's an enormous factor.  And we don't know the answer.  Central banks don't know the answer.  All we know is that it it's been useful in stimulating things and particularly asset prices now for 10 years.  And what we thought was temporary in 2008  and nine in the way of monetary policy to stimulate,  we've just put our foot on the gas even further.  The whole world has.  You made a point in the letter of saying that you don't know how long these interest rates will last.  You and Charlie never try and figure these things out.  But we did have St.  Louis Fed President Jim Bullard on the program last week,  and he said that he expects to see these low interest rates for a long time to come.  That does raise a lot of questions if that happens,  about what this means for the stock market,  what that means for banks,  what that means for insurance companies,  which you touched on in the letter,  too. "
109,0:26:46,0:26:50,BUFFETT," It's bad for insurance companies,  but it's good for stocks. "
110,0:26:51,0:26:57,SPEAKER 1," Bad for insurance companies.  And what happens to the insurance companies as a result?  Are they getting more?  Well, some insurance companies kind of put them at risk. "
111,0:26:57,0:27:19,BUFFETT," The ones that really get hurt are either life or annuity companies that have promised returns.  The property casualty business doesn't promise returns.  It still holds money,  so it hurts them.  But if you promise somebody an annuity that's going to pay them 3 or 4 percent,  and now you find that you're reinvesting your money at 1 percent or something,  you're going to disappear. "
112,0:27:20,0:27:25,SPEAKER 1," Are insurance companies being forced to make riskier and riskier bets?  Well,  they shouldn't.  I mean, the answer, if you need to get 3 percent and you're only getting 1 percent,  the answer is to quit giving 3 percent.  It's not to try and get the 1 up to 3 and do more dangerous things.  You should always adapt your  consumption to your income.  You shouldn't try and adjust your income to your consumption.  That's a basic principle for individuals,  businesses and everything else.  And reaching for yield is really stupid,  but it's very human.  I mean, I understand it.  And people say, well, I've saved all this money all my life and now I can only get 1 percent.  What do I do?  The answer is you learn to live on 1 percent, unfortunately.  And you don't go and listen to some salesman come along and tell you I've got some magic way to get you 5 percent."
116,0:28:18,0:28:24,BUFFETT," Do you think, though, that that's what should be happening?  Do you think that there is more risk taking place in the insurance market?  And you see that in what they call leveraged loans and weaker covenants.  So, no, people are reaching for yield.  There's no question about that.  And that's stupid.  And it has consequences over time.  But it's very human."
118,0:28:40,0:28:43,SPEAKER 1, Consequences that could have a big market impact?
119,0:28:43,0:28:44,BUFFETT, Depends how far it goes.
120,0:28:45,0:28:46,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.
121,0:28:46,0:29:01,BUFFETT," It's the it's  it's something that the things that get built in slowly,  people going crazy and tech companies in the late 1990s,  it can take a lot longer than you think.  But eventually you get to midnight and everything turns to pumpkins and mice. "
122,0:29:02,0:29:18,SPEAKER 1," You know, that's the downside of low interest rates, pensions,  savers,  anybody who gets left in a raw position of that on the alternate side of things.  If rates were to rise rapidly or not,  maybe not even so rapidly,  what does that mean for the federal debt? "
123,0:29:18,0:29:21,BUFFETT," Well, it depends on the average maturity of the debt. "
124,0:29:21,0:29:22,SPEAKER 1," But  our maturities are fairly short.  They've got a lengthened level.  But but if you take  20 trillion and and you're borrowing at 2 percent,  you've got you got 400.  What have you got to do?  Two trillion to 200 billion.  You have 40 billion of the expense.  But if it goes to 5 percent,  you got 100 billion of expense.  I mean, at five percent, you got you got a trillion of expense.  I'm sorry.  It's. "
127,0:29:54,0:30:32,BUFFETT," We are benefiting enormously in our national budget by the fact that interest rates are very low.  And so interest costs has not gone up as you would have anticipated if you were looking at the scene 20 or 30 years ago with the increase in national debt.  But, you know,  Austria issued 100 year bonds,  you know, at  2 percent or thereabouts,  and then they've gone way, way up.  And I think maybe the 1.1 or something like that.  I don't know where they are now.  But it's great if you're a borrower to have to  keep money.  I mean, everybody should refinance their mortgage. "
128,0:30:32,0:30:38,SPEAKER 1," Is that an argument for the Federal Reserve or I'm sorry,  for the Treasury Department here issuing longer,  longer notes? "
130,0:30:56,0:30:56,BUFFETT,"Well, yeah, but I would have said the same thing five or six years ago and been wrong.  But if if we.  Under the president's slope,  it still would cost more to lengthen it out.  But you're lengthening it out at very,  very low rates. And it would be what I would be  inclined to do if I were secretary treasurer.  But I'd have missed a lot of bets in the last 10 years to Warren again for people who are just like,  sure, they're tuning in and they  want to know what you think about this sell off this morning to see the Dow down 700,  800 points in the morning.  What's your reaction when you see something like that?  Well, my reaction is that I like to buy stocks.  So I I don't wish ill on anybody else,  but I like that if they want to sell them to be  cheaper, I prefer it.  So that's a  roughly a 3 percent decline or thereabouts.  I don't know how many 3 percent declines I've had in my lifetime,  but there have been a lot of them.  And I I  can't think of one that you shouldn't have bought on, you know, basically.  That doesn't mean stocks are going to go up or down next week or next month or next year.  But but if there's something if you like to own American businesses,  you're getting a chance to buy a 3 percent cheaper.  I don't consider that a lot cheaper.  I mean, but but but how can it be bad news unless you have to sell stocks?  Now, if you have to sell them for some reason,  it's you're worse off  if you don't have to sell them.  I mean, somebody can come around and offer you a quote on your house today and it could be two percent less than they offered you yesterday.  But if you like the house,  it doesn't make any difference. "
134,0:32:14,0:32:17,SPEAKER 1, Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?
135,0:32:17,0:32:23,BUFFETT," Well, we certainly won't be selling.  And now we may we could easily be buying something.  Sure. "
136,0:32:23,0:32:45,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk a little bit about a Barron's cover story that was just out last week.  The good news on the cover story is they think the Berkshire is worth more than it's selling for right now.  The bad news is they said they think that's in part because there's it's got a big conglomerate discount and they think if you weren't running it,  that it might get broken up.  What's your response to that line of logic?  Well,  conglomerates have had a bad name and for good reason over the years.  I mean, I closed my partnership up  at the end of the 1960s and there was a run,  a very abusive run in conglomerates where they played with numbers and they had dirty pooling,  as they call it,  of accounting.  They wanted to have their stocks up and put out stories to do it so they could issue more stock.  They were kind of chain letter arrangements.  There have been a lot of bad conglomerates and probably disproportionately so compared to the sort of honest to God single industry businesses over time.  We don't think we're that kind of a conglomerate.  We've certainly never wanted to issue shares.  We've never touted shares.  It's done for business reasons in our case.  The interesting thing is, of course,  is the American public has been going wild in their enthusiasm for conglomerates  in the last few years,  if you think about it.  I mean, it's been an  incredibly popular area,  but they call them index funds.  You buy 500 businesses.  I'm trying to figure out what you're talking about. "
141,0:33:49,0:33:52,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, 500 businesses all put together.  I mean, that's the ultimate conglomerate,  isn't it?  I mean, I've recommended index funds to lots of people,  and when they do it,  they're buying into 500 businesses and they're going to have 500 businesses a year from now and five years from now.  And they think that group of businesses will do very well.  And I think our group of businesses will do OK. "
144,0:34:10,0:34:22,SPEAKER 1," The difference with an S&P 500 index is it's 500 different companies run by 500 different management teams who are all focused on their business,  maybe not having a centralized operation that is loosely running all of those. "
145,0:34:22,0:35:49,BUFFETT," Well, we've got our businesses are run by separate people.  I mean, I we just finished Valentine's Day and I did not I did not select what pieces went in the boxes.  And it's been  probably been 10 years at least  since I've been to a C's cannery factory.  Now, I get the figures every month,  but I don't have I don't know how to make chocolate.  I think it was a short I don't pick out the new locations.  We we have managers for our businesses that are very much like the managers we have for the businesses that we own pieces up like American Express or Coca-Cola.  And there's a couple of things we can do.  We can determine the dividend policy of our subsidiaries.  We can control their capital allocation to some extent,  but on most capital allocation, whether to  buy new equipment or anything like that,  they make the decision.  The BNSF Railroad is going to spend three and a half billion dollars on.  I don't I don't approve a single dollar of that in terms of capital expenditures.  They they know what they need to do or they need to lay track how many locomotives they whatever it may be.  So our managers are I would say in a sense,  they're almost more independent than the managers of the S&P 500 who go around and report to Wall Street week after week.  They go to investor relations meeting and they're always explaining what they're doing and trying to get the approval of the analysts and all that sort of thing.  And and we just tell our managers to do what makes sense. "
146,0:35:49,0:35:59,SPEAKER 1," OK, outside of the idea of them not having to report to individual shareholders or the investment community,  what's the advantage of having you there?  The capital allocation part of it? "
147,0:35:59,0:36:56,BUFFETT," Well, we can yeah, we can move capital within.  If you move capital from one stock to another and you had a game,  I mean, you pay a tax and maybe a dividend tax.  So if you sell,  but there's a there's  a lot of taxes incurred in moving from one business to another,  either at the corporate level in some cases,  but certainly at the individual level.  And we can move capital.  Well, just take C's Candy again.  We bought that in 1972.  We've moved  several billion dollars from the candy business to other types of businesses.  And we'd love it if we could use it on the candy business,  but it just isn't that sort of business.  And in addition to that,  we free up our managers from all dealing with Wall Street,  dealing with baggers, dealing with all kinds of things that are what I regard as less productive use of their time. "
148,0:36:57,0:37:21,SPEAKER 1," However, you also have a situation where you have gotten some activists who have been interested in the stock, including Bill Ackman.  He's built up a stake,  hasn't said too much about it,  but I think he has made some comments about how maybe Burlington,  northern Santa Fe's margins could be improved.  You can look back at Bill Ackman's experience with the Canadian Pacific Railway and kind of wonder if he is building up a position because he would like to see you take a more active role there.  Well, we notice what other railroads earn and when their margins are better.  I mean, and we certainly put way less pressure on  than Wall Street might who would want it next week.  But we,  our managers are well aware of what's going on in other industries.  And we've made changes where we don't think some businesses are performing as well as they should.  But overwhelmingly,  we've got managers there that are very, very good. And they've got capital available to them for anything that makes sense. And we decide how much they distribute,  where the capital moves.  And sometimes it moves from one industry to another.  And in certain industries,  a consolidated tax position really is very helpful to us.  There's a viewer question that came in from Ben Comston.  And he asks, it was recently pointed out by Bill Ackman that some subsidiaries like GEICO,  BNSF lagged their peers in some areas.  Would you agree with that?  And how can your successor push improvement in subsidiaries while maintaining a decentralized management structure? "
155,0:38:29,0:39:50,BUFFETT," Well, at GEICO,  we bought control in 1995.  We had about two and a half percent of the market for auto insurance.  And we're at about 13.7 percent of the market.  So we've gone from  two and a half billion of premium volume, or thereabouts,  to 35 billion of premium volume.  We're number two now at a state farm.  We were number  six or seven at that time.  So I would say that not due to Berkshire at all,  but due to Tony Nicely during almost all those years.  GEICO has been the envy of every other company in the  auto insurance business, except for Progressive.  But they've done a good job, too.  But GEICO is worth tens and tens and tens of billions more than when we bought it,  in addition to all the earnings we've gotten,  just the goodwill value.  So that's been extraordinarily well run.  And with  Burlington,  we I think we paid a dividend of five billion last year and we paid 35 billion for it.  So it's gained in market share and its business.  Its operating margins have improved,  but they haven't improved as much as some other railroads. "
156,0:39:51,0:39:53,SPEAKER 1," Do you believe in precision scheduling railroading?   Well, we'll see.  I mean, we've watched it plenty.  And for those who don't know what that is,  it's something that kind of irritates customers because it makes things a little more rigid.  But it does."
159,0:40:04,0:40:13,BUFFETT," Yeah, it makes the customers adapt to the railroad more than the railroad adapting the customers.  And practically everybody's done it.  And a fellow named Hunter Harrison was enormously successful. "
160,0:40:13,0:40:15,SPEAKER 1, He worked with Bill Ackman at the Canadian Pacific.
161,0:40:16,0:40:59,BUFFETT," Yeah, he worked for the BNSF,  if you go back far enough.  He and there's a book about his very own.  But he did it at the Illinois Central,  the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific.  And then he was going over to the CSX.  He he he developed a method of railroading where the customer does adapt more to the  railroad and improve margins dramatically.  Our margins are close to what the better railroads.  Well, there's only a few that get from precision railroading.  I mean, then we've gained share because the customers don't like because the railroads  apparently or the railroad customers like us better.  And over the  over the long term,  we'll see.  But it isn't like it's something we can't do. "
162,0:41:00,0:44:55,SPEAKER 1," Here's the latest on the coronavirus.  China reported an additional 150 deaths and 409 new cases overnight.  South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after the number of cases there ballooned from 31 to more than 750 in less than a week.  Stocks  in Asia falling overnight.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell one point eight percent.  South Korea's Cosby fell nearly three point nine percent.  Shares of South Korea's two largest airlines down as they canceled flights to the city of Daegu,  where many of the new cases were detected.  Meantime,  Italy's government is scrambling to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of Asia.  Stocks there were lower overnight.  The government placed at least 10 towns in northern Italy under quarantine and canceled the last few days of the Venice Carnival.  Elsewhere in Italy, schools, museums, universities and cinemas were closed and major soccer matches were canceled.  At this point,  I mean, Boris Johnson out earlier today and are saying that the risk to UK citizens just over there remains low.  I would say that  our officials would say that here,  too.  The risk to the U.S.  citizens remains low.  But there's a significant difference between supply chain disruption slowing dozens and dozens and actually hundreds of companies.  Absolutely.  And that's dampening global growth.  What worries me is that we don't know three,  three months, six months, nine months, if it ever gets to the point where we start to see in a lot of  countries around the world,  these these break outs where they don't even know the origin of some of these.  And if they multiply like that,  that's when I think it could really get at this point.  It's still a it's still a global growth slowdown.  Nobody in most of the world is worried that they're going to catch coronavirus.  Right.  And they can't go out and they can't go to the movies or the health club or to a restaurant.  But that I just wonder,  we don't know.  There are major travel that's being changed right now.  Conferences are being canceled.  There was an article in Time magazine speculating when the weather the Olympics in Japan over the summer will be canceled.  So there's real implications here that could reverberate.  Having said that, the farther we get to the spring,  the better it gets in terms of weather.  There's a whole sort of it about how the flu,  you know, you know, I was looking at Jim's some of Jim's tweets earlier.  If you go too far with with the the fear and the panic,  you're accused of one thing.  If you don't go far enough,  you're accused of the other thing.  So we really just need to sit here and each day report on the facts and try to remain attached.  But there's something something about a pandemic that just is different than other black swans.  It's it's it's a frightening prospect.  Anyway, let's get right back to our guest of the morning.  Warren Buffett joins Becky in Omaha following the release of his annual letter to  shareholders over the weekend.  And Becky, you took a plane.  I mean, it's in the back of our minds,  is it?  It's just in the back.  There's no way.  And the risks are low.  It goes back to 1918.  It goes back to 1980.  And if you look at the numbers of what happened in that pandemic when it came around the  globe, up to 50 million people were killed in that.  It was a third of the planet's population that was infected.  It was 500 million people that were infected at that point.  Six hundred seventy five thousand Americans died at that point.  So inevitably,  your mind kind of goes back to what's happened in the past,  because as humans, we always look back to history to try and predict the future.  It doesn't always work.  It's not always prophetic,  but it does give you something  of what to kind of play out if this were to get worse and worse.  Now, Andrew brought up the idea that it's warm weather.  We're approaching spring in a lot of parts of the country,  a lot of parts of the planet  that may be good news.  We just don't know if this time around,  if this is one of those viruses that that does die off in warmer weather.  Wait and see.  Kind of hope.   Yeah, actually,  I  think this from what I've heard from people that know a lot more about viruses than I do, that that that  unfortunately, this will make it through the summer.  And and in terms of having a vaccine,  it's a long ways off.  So you've got  it is scary stuff.  I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks,  but but in terms of in terms of the human race,  it's scary stuff when you have a pandemic.  Yeah, I guess this one's particularly frightening because it's new.  So there's no natural immunity that's built up in any of the populations.  And you wonder what happens,  particularly in areas where there's not the same health care structure that we have in America or in some of the developed nations.  I guess that's a big part of the question, too.  Yeah,  it's  it's.  Well, I think about it in terms of our annual meeting.  I mean, that which is May 2nd.  I mean, it it could very well affect by that time.  It could affect.  We've got questions from viewers asking just that.  Will the annual meeting be any different this year,  particularly because you have a large  Chinese contingency of shareholders? "
169,0:46:07,0:46:21,BUFFETT," Yeah, I don't think that certainly will be affected.  And and incidentally, I mean, flu is particularly tough on old people.  You're going to have two guys on the stage who's  combined ages one hundred eighty five. "
170,0:46:21,0:46:21,SPEAKER 1," So,  yeah, well, we won't be looking for people showing any signs of contagion.  But that's one of the problems with this is it does have a long gestation period and it's highly transmissible. And again, you did talk about it earlier.  It's something that you see in the results of the businesses,  even some of your own fully owned businesses that you didn't anticipate."
173,0:46:43,0:46:47,BUFFETT," Well, we own airlines, for example.  It affects businesses now. "
174,0:46:48,0:46:48,SPEAKER 1," Actually,  my dad used to tell me a story.  He was 14 in 1918 and he told me what went on in Omaha during the  big Spanish flu epidemic.  I mean, it was it was something in those days and and pandemics will.  Occur in the future now,  what they hope to get is is a universal flu vaccine,  but that's a long way off.  It isn't impossible.  I mean, I asked my my own science advisers,  Bill Gates, so I talked to him, I call him.  I've talked to him the last few days about about it.  And he's bullish on the long term outlook for a universal  prevention of it.  But but he says it's not going to come,  you know, for it's not going to be here in 10 years.  What are what are Bill's concerns as somebody who spends a lot of time traveling around the globe,  as somebody who is trying to help medicine in some of the less developed parts of the world? "
178,0:47:49,0:47:49,BUFFETT,"Yeah, the Gates Foundation is  is very active in trying to be helpful on this. And and Bill says the CDC is the best in the world.  And I mean, we've got terrific  resources in this country,  but a pandemic is a pandemic.  And and there's just no evaluating.  But I have heard that  the summer is not likely to  cause the end of this."
180,0:48:11,0:48:12,SPEAKER 1, Do you know why?
181,0:48:12,0:48:20,BUFFETT," But I don't know.  And, you know, you shouldn't be asking.  I shouldn't be offering my opinion on that because I I pass along things I hear from people I think are smart. "
182,0:48:20,0:48:24,SPEAKER 1," But but I'm actually asking for Bill's opinion, not yours.  Well,  well,  I shouldn't and I shouldn't really quote him,  but I do.  He's the guy I ask.  And I did talk to just a few days ago.  And he loves to talk science and he can make it so I can understand it,  which is quite a trick.  You know,  at the Gates Foundation,  they're taking it very seriously.  I'll put it that way.  Is money going from the Gates Foundation to try and find a vaccine? "
185,0:48:48,0:48:51,BUFFETT, I'm sure we are expending human and financial resources.
186,0:48:53,0:49:02,SPEAKER 1," Have I mean, maybe this is more than,  you know, but, you know, if they have put human resources out either into China or other places where they don't know that. "
187,0:49:02,0:49:15,BUFFETT, I don't want to comment on that.  But I know that there that that is something they've always spent.  They've been very involved in is human health and and even particularly this bill knows a lot about vaccines.
188,0:49:16,0:49:32,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk a little bit about Berkshire Hathaway.  We were in the middle of a conversation when we had to go to a break before.  But there has been this question raised not only by Barron's in the cover story there,  but by other places, too,  about whether Berkshire Hathaway would be worth more if it were split up. "
189,0:49:32,0:51:23,BUFFETT," That's a good question.  And I will tell you that that  if you were to say and let's say the stock market didn't change for two years and interest rates didn't change.  So you had a two year period and you said we'll sell off all the businesses.  I don't think  I mean, you have the expenses of selling them now.  If you sold them all to people who leveraged them up to their maximum,  you might get a little more than the stock is selling for.  It would be very tax inefficient,  very tax inefficient.  Interestingly enough,  up till 1986,  it wouldn't have been.  I mean, there was a general utilities doctrine that governed corporate breakups.  And so you could dispose of  businesses or securities.  If you did it right,  you could dispose of securities or businesses that are appreciated  without a tax at the corporate level.  That was done regularly in various ways up till 1986.  They revised the tax code big time.  They killed general utilities.  You can't do that now.  Now you can go you can have spinoffs,  this business or that business.  You probably have to lie a little in terms of your purpose in order to  get the best tax ruling.  And it takes time.  But you cannot break up.  You cannot dispose of the entire business,  business by business,  without having very substantial tax liability.  It would not produce a gain.  On the other hand,  having them together produces there's some very valuable synergies in there.  Now, we don't use leverage as much as the people who would buy them piece by piece would do.  So we could leverage  Berkshire up to the sky.  I promise people we won't because we have insurance promises to people out 50 or 100 years and we've got shareholders are going to own the stock for 50 years and they do not want us to  to leverage to the sky. "
190,0:51:23,0:51:23,SPEAKER 1," But  there would not be a profit if if  we were simply to announce that over the next 24 months that you could come in and buy any business we had and we'd sell them to the highest bidder.  You made a point of talking about this in the annual letter.  You said key to my only Berkshire key to my Berkshire only institutions is my faith in the future judgment of fidelity of Berkshire directors.  They will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees and many companies.  These super salesmen might win.  I do not,  however, expect this to happen. "
193,0:51:54,0:53:15,BUFFETT," That's exactly true.  And I think by writing it,  it helps a little too.  No, there's no question that that Wall Street would love to come along and sell anything that we've got.  I mean, there's a fee every time that there's a transaction and they're big fees and there's fees for financing.  I mean, there's so we've had all kinds of  people snoop around that they know they're not getting done with me,  but they won't get done later on either.  I am leaving every every share of Berkshire goes to charity and it's ninety nine percent of my net worth.  So I got  nobody cares more than I do about getting the most money to those philanthropies over the four of the years following my death.  And that's going to take place over 15 years.  And I say keep it all in Berkshire.  But if I thought that it was going to be run in a way responsive to  Wall Street, I would I would instead do something else and have the money distributed to these philanthropies and not have it all tied to Berkshire.  But Berkshire has a very unusual shareholder base.  I mean, we have individuals that own Berkshire and a lot of them have owned it 50 years.  Just like it's people buy it to own for a lifetime.  And and we're going to run it in a way that they won't be disappointed. "
194,0:53:15,0:53:24,SPEAKER 1," Do you think the people who are newer,  relatively newer shareholders buying the B shares have the same mentality as the people who have been in it for 50 years? "
195,0:53:24,0:54:44,BUFFETT," Well, we try to because that's who we encourage.  I mean, in effect,  we don't want everybody to buy our stock.  I mean, there's only so many seats.  There's about a million six hundred and some thousand a shares out.  All the seats are filled.  I love the shareholders we have.  I don't want to go to Wall Street and try and get some new shareholders  to replace the people we have.  So what we want to have is people in those seats that are in sync with us.  You can run a French restaurant or you can run a hamburger stand.  And if you serve good hamburgers,  you'll do good business.  They have a standing at the French restaurant.  You do the same thing there.  But you can't run the French restaurant and serve hamburgers inside.  And you can't run the hamburger stand and serve French food inside.  So we advertise in our deeds,  in our words and every way we can what we're about.  And we're looking to have the seats filled at our church  by people who are in sync with us.  And we do have them there.  We get the same people every Sunday.  And I see no advantage in going out and telling everybody in Wall Street we're going to do wonderful things and having those seats replaced,  because the only way you can get a seat is to throw somebody else out of that seat.  There's only so many seats and they're all full.  And you want them filled with people who are in sync  with the with the policies of the company.  And therefore, you have to explain those policies and you have to live up to those policies.  And for 55 years,  we've tried to. "
196,0:54:45,0:54:55,SPEAKER 1," So you get the shareholders you deserve.  Exactly.  All right.  Not to mix metaphors,  but can you have a decentralized central office running both the French restaurant and the hamburger place?  Well,  they aren't trying.  We're not trying to have the railroad management run the utility.  You're decentralized.  That's what I mean.  A decentralized headquarters that's in charge,  a conglomerate in charge of all those different businesses. "
199,0:55:06,0:55:18,BUFFETT," Well, we could run.  Well, we have decentralized management as it is.  We could have somebody in charge of all the little companies,  another one for the big.  I mean, we could visualize it in all kinds of ways.  I think we'd have more overhead.  I think we'd have a different sort of manager.  Our managers like running their own businesses and they they like  they never have to finance their businesses.  I mean, they never have to go to Wall Street.  They never they probably save 25 percent of their time.  And and I want them to feel they own their businesses.  And that's all they're responsible for.  If we mess up some other way, you know,  they still they get paid based on how they do.  And and there again,  we attract managers who like to operate on that basis.  We don't attract managers,  particularly who think they're going to keep moving step by step  through various divisions and eventually run the whole place. "
202,0:56:07,0:56:39,SPEAKER 1," One of the things that people wrote in,  a lot of people had questions about the banks,  about what's happening with the banks,  what you've changed with some of your investments over time.  Jason Goldberg writes in,  he says, please ask more about his views on the bank stocks in general and on Wells Fargo in particular.  Over the last two quarters,  he sold almost a quarter of his longstanding Wells Fargo stake.  Also in the fourth quarter,  he dumped a third of his Goldman stock Goldman Sachs shares,  although he still owns over seventy five billion dollars in bank equities.  So what do you think about banks?  Not necessarily the sell off today because you don't look at day by day.  Well,  banking is a good business if you don't do dumb things on the asset side."
204,0:56:43,0:56:43,BUFFETT," I mean, basically,  and it's a business that the banks we own earn between  the commercial banks earn between 12 percent  and 16 percent or so on  tangible assets.  That's a good business.  It's a fantastic business against  the long term bond.  You know, a two percent.  If you have a choice between a two percent instrument and a 12 percent instrument,  which one is going to win over time?  So,  so if you ask me whether I think banks are going to go down where they only earn three or four percent on tangible assets,  I don't think that'll happen.  The question is really whether they do something massively dumb.  I mean, which periodically a number of banks have done.  And I feel very good about the banks we own.  They're  they're very attractive compared to most other securities I see.  And and most of them are buying Bank of America is buying in a lot of stock every year.  So our ownership of the Bank of America this year probably will go up seven or eight percent without a spending a dime.  I'd like to own any business,  any good business where my ownership is up seven or eight percent every year without me spending any money.  And on top of it, I get a dividend.  So they're very they're very attractive,  both against interest rates and against or against bonds and against other stocks, in my view. "
210,0:58:13,0:58:31,SPEAKER 1," You say occasionally they do dumb things.  Maybe you're talking about Wells Fargo with the scandal that it had.  It just settled on Friday with a number of the regulatory institutions that were kind of looking into it,  the investigations that were taking place for three billion dollars.  Does this mean that they have kind of finally gotten through that and can move forward? "
211,0:58:32,0:58:36,BUFFETT, I don't know the answer to that.  I know that they paid three billion because it was announced.  I don't know what else is outstanding.
212,0:58:37,0:58:37,SPEAKER 1," But  Wells Fargo is classic in in in terms of one lesson.  My partner, Charlie, he says whenever we have a problem,  you attack it immediately.  He says an ounce of perversion,  an ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure.  An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.  And we've seen that time after time. And the interesting thing I and I don't know the details at all, but  the original thing was a bunch of a whole bunch of phony accounts.  Now, I don't know how if you open up a couple of million phony accounts,  you make any money on it at all.  I mean, I don't the shareholders didn't make money.  People say that, well, the incentive structure was set up so that some of the employees  don't have a system.  You can think and as soon as you learn,  you can devise dumb incentive systems.  We've done ourselves.  I mean, you can you can cause people to do the wrong thing because they will do what they're incented to do.  And they had obviously a very dumb incentive system.  People started playing it various ways.  And the big thing is they ignored it when they found out about it.  I mean, you're going to do dumb things in business and we do them every day.  You know, but the you absolutely have to attack a problem  as soon as it occurs.  And you know about it. And if that had happened,  Wells Fargo shareholders would be a lot better off.  But Wells Fargo shareholders did not did not profit from opening up accounts that were phony accounts that had nothing in them.  I mean, somebody was getting paid so much per account.  So and the practice spread because bad practices do spread if they're allowed to spread.  And they were ignored, which is  a total disaster.  And and look at the consequences.  So two or three years later, who's paying?  The shareholders are paying for something that didn't do them any good whatsoever.  Is that why you've sold off some of the shares? "
223,1:00:28,1:00:29,BUFFETT," No, not specifically. "
224,1:00:30,1:00:34,SPEAKER 1, I know you don't want to get specific on why.
225,1:00:34,1:00:39,BUFFETT," No, I'm not.  I'm not recommending what stocks people have to make up their own minds on that. "
226,1:00:39,1:01:14,SPEAKER 1," But OK,  I want to ask you a question about Todd Combs and his new role at Geico.  I got several questions that came in from that.  And let's just use this one from Peter Lampras.  During last year's interview on CNBC,  after the 2018 letter was released,  you were asked about succession at Geico.  And you mentioned that at a recent meeting at Geico,  you met about 40 of their top executives.  And after each introduced themselves,  they stated their length of time with the company.  The shortest was 19 years.  Please explain why none of these 40 top executives were qualified to take over as CEO after the retirement of Bill Roberts.  Again, that's Pete Lampras from Chicago.   Bill Roberts took over.  Not even two years ago and last and he has done a terrific job in connection with Tony.  And I mean,  Geico is my first love.  Absolutely.  I tell the other companies that you can't compete for my second love,  but you can't compete for my first love,  which is Geico, because it goes back 60,  69 years.  And it did wonderful.  Anyway,  Geico,  Bill Roberts took over a little less than two years ago.  And then in either October or November last year,  he said he would he'd like to retire in a year.  He would  adjust it in any way that  made it the easiest for us.  And and we did not have the person,  in my view,  to replace him at that point.  And Todd Combs,  who's worked with Berkshire now for 10 years,  he actually was a product manager at Progressive in the past.  And he knows a lot about insurance.  Insurance is probably the only business I know something about that we're in.  All the rest of them are full of confusion.  But I understand the insurance business to some degree.  Todd understands it very well at the operating level.  And so Todd is there.  And I hope very much that that he's not there very long because I'd like to get him back to Omaha.  But our intention always is to promote from within.  And we would hope to pick out the right person at Geico.  It isn't that there isn't somebody there.  It's just you want to have the right one,  because when you put somebody in,  you're going to keep them there for a long time.  And or her.  And does that suggest Todd is not going to be there for a long time?"
229,1:03:01,1:03:14,BUFFETT," I don't think he's going to know.  No, the plan is not for him to be.  I mean, he has not made a permanent career shift.  And he you know,  I don't know how long he'll be there. "
230,1:03:14,1:03:14,SPEAKER 1," We have  we have one important problem, which is  which all insurance companies have.  But "
233,1:03:21,1:03:36,BUFFETT, Progressive has done a better job of of managing of of of  of correlating or risk with with rate.  And that  is what we're focused on now.
234,1:03:37,1:03:38,SPEAKER 1, Correlating risk with rate.
235,1:03:38,1:03:40,BUFFETT," In other words, having the proper rate. "
236,1:03:40,1:03:41,SPEAKER 1, Right.  Charging the right amount.
237,1:03:41,1:03:57,BUFFETT," Charging the right amount.  If you were in the life insurance business and you thought that 80 year olds had the same life expectancy as 20 year olds,  you'd have a big problem.  And what would happen is you'd write all the 80 year olds and somebody would write all the 20 year olds.  So in auto insurance,  the same thing.  There's a vast difference. "
238,1:03:57,1:04:00,SPEAKER 1, Auto insurance.  I'm not sure I might prefer the 80 year olds over the 20.
239,1:04:00,1:04:52,BUFFETT," Well, you might.  And you certainly would prefer the 80 year olds to the 16 year olds.  I mean, yeah.  And you'd prefer the 16 year old female to the 16 year old male.  There's a whole bunch of things.  So you've got a core.  You really got to segment risks.  And that's enormously important.  And every company is trying to do it better all the time.  And we do it far better than we did 50 years ago.  But we have room for improvement on that.  We're focused on that.  And in the meantime,  we're growing faster.  We're gaining market share.  Geico is a fantastic asset.  Todd's job is to focus on that,  but it's also to work himself out of a job very,  very quickly and preferably to work.  Definitely, preferably to work himself out of a job with somebody from Geico. "
240,1:04:52,1:05:07,SPEAKER 1," Eric Lafont writes a follow up question.  He says, Warren, why did you and Ajit decide to appoint Todd Combs as the CEO of Geico?  That part you've answered.  But how will he be able to run Geico,  manage a 13 billion dollar investment portfolio,  oversee Haven and be on the board of J.P.  Morgan? "
241,1:05:07,1:05:12,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, let's get it'll keep him busy.  And we've told him he's unlimited use of a net jet. "
242,1:05:12,1:05:13,SPEAKER 1, So really?
243,1:05:13,1:05:45,BUFFETT," Oh, sure.  No, I mean, we want him to be efficient.  That's what that just is for.  And and and he'll be working 70 hour weeks.  The the question about the portfolio is interesting.  Most months,  neither Ted nor Todd makes a single change in their portfolio.  I mean, portfolio management is something that you learn over decades.  And when I ran Solomon,  I was running Berkshire portfolio.  It is not something that you have to sit there day by day and do.  People do it that way. "
244,1:05:46,1:05:46,SPEAKER 1," But.   If  there are many years where if I just left the portfolio entirely the same and didn't make any changes,  we'd be better off.  So it that's not about.  But but you're right in terms of J.P.  Morgan's board.  He's he's going to be a very busy guy.  Geico is the top priority,  but it isn't going to say the top priority for a long, long time.  And let me run to another question that Max 0205 wrote in.  Have Todd Combs and Ted Weschler outperformed the S&P 500 since they began working at Berkshire?  Why don't you disclose their record?"
247,1:06:21,1:06:22,BUFFETT, Why don't I?
248,1:06:22,1:06:24,SPEAKER 1," Why don't you disclose their record?  They said, well,  we're not disclosing.  I think it would be very unusual for a firm to discover disclose everybody's sales last year.  Among their salespeople or anything like that.  I mean, they're entitled to work in relative  anonymity.  Our directors know how they do.  I know how they do.  We made a lot of money with them.  I feel very good.  I mean, I feel very good about them in all ways.  But we're not going to we're not going to tell you how much each candy store sells.  It's sees candy or who was the top the top person that  at any place brought in the sales or whatever it may be.  All right.  Let's jump to Berkshire's overall record versus S&P.  Berkshire has now underperformed the S&P 500 on one year,  three year, five year and 10 year marks.  Yeah.  Is that because it's too big and will it ever be able to outperform? "
251,1:07:16,1:08:04,BUFFETT," Well, certainly being too big as part of it.  And but I would say this  during that same time.  I mean, last year we achieved now I don't like it.  Gap earnings very well,  but we achieved the highest  gap earnings of any company in the world has ever achieved.  That's investor owned.  And we have the highest net worth of any company in the world.  Investor owned any company in the world.  So it.  I would say.  Related to safety of principle over time,  I feel good about it and I feel good about the fact  that 99 percent of my money is in it and that  it will be the source of all the philanthropic  contributions that are made for 15 or dozen years after I die. "
252,1:08:04,1:08:04,SPEAKER 1, So.
253,1:08:05,1:08:21,BUFFETT, But I don't think  I do not think  it will be in the top 10 percent  of stocks performing over the next 10 years.  I don't think it'll be in the top 15 percent of stocks performing in the next  10 or 15 years.  I also don't think it'll be in the bottom 10 percent or 20 percent or 30 percent.
254,1:08:21,1:08:21,SPEAKER 1, So.
255,1:08:22,1:08:34,BUFFETT," But our ability to  have a huge edge over the market generally with a 550 billion dollar market value.  It's just  it'll be minor, but it'll be done in a very, very safe manner. "
256,1:08:35,1:08:39,SPEAKER 1, Is an investment in the S&P 500 a better investment?  It could be.  It could be.
257,1:08:39,1:09:17,BUFFETT," You know,  on balance, I think we'll do a little better, but it'll be.  It'll be minor, depends on the kind of market where we're in a down market.  We're going to beat it.  I mean, it's that simple.  And sometimes we will be the last 10 years we haven't been.  But  over 55 years, it's worked and it will continue working,  but it will not work at all like it did  when we were working with 100 million dollars or a billion dollars.  There's no question about that.  But we've got good businesses and we're.  We won't be in the bottom quarter.  I promise you that over any long period of time. "
258,1:09:18,1:09:52,SPEAKER 1," There are people like there were back in 1999 who have said maybe you've lost your edge.  It was a similar thing in 1999 where you saw the technology stocks that were the big high flyers that people were pouring their money into the dot com companies and a lot of others associated with that.  If you look at the markets again,  it's the technology companies that have the big runs.  This time you're participating in Apple,  which is one of those front runners.  But is this a cyclical thing to you?  You think there'll be another market downturn and then there'll be a downturn sometime.  And then Berkshire outperforms at that point or will outperform in a down market.  But  but that may not be particularly satisfactory to people.  But no, we will, because we have these businesses are making money.  And I mean, we are we are not  we're geared somewhat away from a full market  participation on in either direction.  But that's fine.  We own if you think about it,  we're 80 some percent in equities.  We may so show two hundred and thirty or forty billion in equities and that looks like we're against our market cap.  We're 40 percent, but we own 100 percent of these other businesses.  Those are equities, too.  I mean, we own a right and we own insurance companies and those are those are equities.  So we're about 80 percent in  roughly in equities and about 20 percent in cash.  And I'd rather I'd rather have that 20 percent and other good businesses.  But but that is to some extent a curse of size.  And it's to some extent the fact that that.  It's very hard if interest rates stay at this level,  we'll wish we'd for the next 10 or 20 years,  we'll wish we'd been one hundred and twenty five percent in equities.  I mean, you know, equities are so much cheaper than bonds, long bonds,  that.  You know, some something will change in a major way.  I just don't know what.  And I want to be prepared for anything, obviously.  So that's why you keep so much cash around.  You want to be able to be prepared for a downturn.  You want to be prepared for a crisis. "
261,1:11:20,1:11:58,BUFFETT," We want to be prepared for anything.  We want to be prepared for pandemics.  We want to be prepared for anything comes along.  Now, that is the chief job I have.  I have people's money.  They gave it to me 50 or 60 years ago and some of them still have 100 percent of their money or essentially.  And and the one thing and I've got the responsibility for five foundations that presently are going to get 80 billion.  And I think we'll get a lot more over time.  Probably.  We don't want to permanently lose money.  And you don't want to get that so that you go into a shell and don't do anything. "
262,1:11:59,1:11:59,SPEAKER 1," But  we have obligations to people on workers' compensation claims and auto accidents.  They've had to go out 50 years.  And,  you know, we have to run the place so that every check clears under any circumstances.  And that's why we incidentally own Treasury bills.  We don't we don't own commercial paper.  We don't rely on bank lines or anything.  When people get terrified and they will occasionally everything freezes.  And you're going to have to stand on your own feet at a time like that.  It won't happen very often,  but it'll happen occasionally.  I know you've developed a thick skin over the years,  but does it tick you off  when people start questioning whether you've lost it,  whether you can still.   Well, I'm sure I've lost some of it.  I can tell you all kinds of things I've lost.  No, that happens.  But we haven't lost  Geico or the railroads.  Berkshire without me is worth essentially the same as Berkshire with me.  I mean, my value added is not high,  but"
269,1:13:02,1:13:32,BUFFETT," I don't think I'm subtracting value.  But the big thing is how our businesses do and what what what we get to add in the way of businesses over time.  And we can add them to marketable securities.  I mean, we own five and a half or a little over a percent of Apple.  It's probably the best business I know in the world.  And we own five and a half percent of it.  And that is a bigger  commitment that we have in anything except insurance  and the railroad.  So it's it's our third largest business. "
270,1:13:33,1:13:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I made the point that it was bigger than your biggest acquisition of precision.
271,1:13:36,1:13:38,BUFFETT," Oh, sure.  Now it's our third largest business. "
272,1:13:38,1:13:52,SPEAKER 1," All  right.  Let me test you on your thick skin.  Wow.  Here was the kicker of that Barron's cover story.  He said there's reasons to think that the company will be a market beater when he's gone.  In the meantime, happy 90th. "
273,1:13:52,1:14:07,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, that's I hope it is a market beater.  Well, I'm counting on I'm telling my estate and then the trustees that succeed my executors in the state.  I'm telling them to keep every share of Berkshire they have until they have this pattern of giving it away. "
274,1:14:07,1:14:08,SPEAKER 1," I mean,  I want them to look back and say,  gee, we should have made this change earlier because it's going to determine,  you know, how much we buy in the way of vaccines and,  you know, and all kinds of things,  education and all these things.  And I feel terrific about Berkshire after I leave.  I want to talk about another issue that we have not touched on yet,  and that's politics here in the United States.  We just watched the Nevada caucus.  Bernie Sanders walked away with the most delegates after that.  He looks to be as the clear front runner for the nomination for the Democrats this time around.  You have long been a supporter of the Democratic Party.  What do you think? "
277,1:14:50,1:15:21,BUFFETT," Well, I think I'm going to wait and see who gets the nomination,  but I'm a Democrat,  but I'm not a card carrying Democrat.  And I've voted for Republicans.  I've contributed to Republicans.  In fact,  I've only run for two offices in my life.  One was head of the young Republicans at the University of Pennsylvania.  And the other time I was actually on the ballot running for a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1960.  But normally I vote for Democrats and we will see what happens. "
278,1:15:22,1:15:25,SPEAKER 1, Wow.  That's the first time I've ever heard you say something like that.
279,1:15:25,1:15:29,BUFFETT," Well, I've kept it a secret for all these years,  but now it comes out. "
280,1:15:29,1:15:32,SPEAKER 1, You just said that you're not a card carrying Democrat.
281,1:15:32,1:15:32,BUFFETT, That's true.
282,1:15:33,1:15:37,SPEAKER 1, You are a card carrying capitalist.  You actually have one of those in your wallet.  I've seen it.
283,1:15:38,1:15:48,BUFFETT," I don't know whether I'm a card carrying capitalist, right?  I don't think that's consistent with inconsistent with what I've said on politics.  Here it is.  I don't know whether that shows. "
284,1:15:48,1:15:50,SPEAKER 1," Those who can't see,  I'll show you on this camera right here. "
285,1:15:50,1:15:50,BUFFETT," Card carrying capitalist.   This is what you carry in your wallet.  Yeah.  And I think I think we will have some of those available at the annual meeting, too.  For our shareholders."
288,1:15:58,1:16:13,SPEAKER 1," I think Andrew's got a question that he wanted to jump in with here.  Andrew,  I was just going to follow up on that question,  Warren, which was about a year ago.  We had asked you about Michael Bloomberg and you had said that if he ever  entered the race, he was somebody you would support.  Would you support him?  Is he your candidate? "
289,1:16:14,1:16:25,BUFFETT," Well, I would say I would certainly I would certainly vote for him.  I don't think I don't think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. "
290,1:16:26,1:16:26,SPEAKER 1," But  sure, I would I would have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg. And what do you think his chances are?"
293,1:16:37,1:17:40,BUFFETT," Well, I don't think I want to get into handicapping the race,  but I would say this in terms of Sanders.  I actually agree with him in terms of certain things he would  like to accomplish.  I don't agree with him in many ways.  But in terms of the fact that that  we ought to do better by the people that get left behind by our capitalist system,  I don't think we  should kill the capital system in the process.  I think we should make sure that the Golden Goose  keeps laying more eggs.  And it's worked wonderfully since 1776.  But it doesn't work as well for people  whose talents aren't really geared to a market economy.  And I don't think anybody should be left  behind by an economy that has over sixty thousand dollars of GDP per capita.  And so I'm a big fan of increasing the earned income tax credit.  And I'm I'm you  know, I think there should be some changes made.  But but if given the choice,  I wouldn't certainly vote for Mike Bloomberg as opposed to Sanders. "
294,1:17:41,1:18:01,SPEAKER 1," There is a plan.  Let's talk about some of Sanders plans.  You said you agree with some of  what his intentions are.  But let's talk about some of those actual plans.  One of those plans would be to give 20 percent of company stock to employees and put workers on the board.  What do you think about that?  That would be for any company,  public company that has more than 100 million dollars in annual revenue or 100 million dollar balance. "
295,1:18:01,1:18:06,BUFFETT," Well, I don't want to get involved in evaluating this whole plan,  but I think that would be a particularly bad idea. "
296,1:18:06,1:18:07,SPEAKER 1, Because?
297,1:18:08,1:19:28,BUFFETT," Well, I just I don't think that I don't think putting 20 percent of the capitalists out of labor unions is a good idea.  And I I think the market system works very,  very well in terms of developing more goods and services.  I mean, when you flew out here to Omaha,  if you'd flown out here and you wouldn't be able to fly in 1776,  you wouldn't have seen anything.  Everything you see is the product of a system that's worked like nothing's ever worked in the history of the world.  So I do not believe in messing up  our system of developing output.  I do believe that  that anybody is willing to work 40 hours a week and has a couple of kids should not have to have an extra second job.  And I believe in having a higher income for people,  not necessarily a higher minimum wage,  but I do not think it's at all unreasonable that the income tax credit produces at least as 15 dollars an hour,  maybe higher in certain areas.  Is it so I  I'm in very much in sympathy with the fact that that that  Senator Sanders believes that a lot of people are getting left behind and through no fault of their own.  And there's all kinds of aspects of capitalism that can need in some ways to be  regulated.  But I don't believe in giving up the capitalistic system. "
298,1:19:28,1:19:41,SPEAKER 1, All right.  Let me slip in some questions that viewers have written in on this front.  Michael Blank writes in.  Please ask Warren if he thinks the market will sell off if it becomes clear that Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic nomination.  I think
299,1:19:42,1:19:48,BUFFETT," I normally would never make a comment on something like that,  but I would say that. "
300,1:19:48,1:19:50,SPEAKER 1, If.
301,1:19:51,1:20:12,BUFFETT," You had  Sanders and a Democratic House and Senate.  Or if you had Trump with a Republican House and Senate.  There would be a significant difference.  But I don't think I would necessarily vote on what.  In fact, I know I wouldn't vote  on what I thought necessarily would affect the market. "
302,1:20:12,1:20:12,SPEAKER 1, The better.
303,1:20:12,1:20:24,BUFFETT, I think it's a very poor yardstick.  I would not want to cast my vote in a presidential election based on  which would be better for the market in the next 30 or 60 or 90 days after the election.
304,1:20:24,1:20:32,SPEAKER 1," But your reservations with Bernie Sanders,  I assume, come with your concerns about what it means for the economy,  not over 30, 60, 90 days over a much broader period. "
305,1:20:32,1:20:40,BUFFETT," Certain aspects of the economy,  certain things I'd like to see done.  I would like to see the earned income tax credit chain dramatically upward. "
306,1:20:42,1:20:48,SPEAKER 1," Alan Bucky writes in a letter,  he says, if Michael Bloomberg becomes the Democratic candidate,  would you consider buying his company? "
307,1:20:48,1:20:52,BUFFETT," No,  I can give you a categorical answer. "
308,1:20:54,1:21:21,SPEAKER 1," Because of the price,  because of the.  That'd be that'd be something.  Pay more.  And we've talked this morning about the coronavirus.  But there are people who are waking up across the country now kind of tuning in at this  hour.  So maybe we should address this again with the markets indicated down 750 points  with concerns about coronavirus spreading and now worries about what that will mean for the  global economy this year.  I know this is not something you look at a day by day basis,  but how do you kind of wake  up and read this and think through it? "
309,1:21:22,1:22:00,BUFFETT," I don't think it makes no difference in our investments.  I mean, there's always going to be some news,  good or bad, every day.  In fact, if you go back and read all the papers for the last 50 years,  probably most of the headlines tend to be bad.  But but if you look at what happens to the economy,  most of the things happen are extremely good.  I mean, it's incredible what will happen over time.  So if the  if somebody came and told me that the global growth rate was going to be down 1 percent instead of a tenth of a percent,  I'd still buy stocks if I felt like the business and I like the price at which they and I like the price better today than I liked them last Friday. "
310,1:22:01,1:22:05,SPEAKER 1," Do you like prices better today?  Will Berkshire be buying stock today?  Well,  we'll certainly be more inclined to buy stock today than on Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah. "
313,1:22:12,1:22:17,BUFFETT," Anything we were buying Friday,  we will be buying today.  And and feeling better about buying it. "
314,1:22:17,1:22:35,SPEAKER 1," You know, one of the things you talked about in the annual letter was  stock buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway.  Right.  And for the first time you told people to call Mark Millard in your office  outright if they have 20 million dollars worth of Berkshire shares and they're ready to sell.  Right.  That's a really unusual move.  Why did you do that? "
315,1:22:35,1:23:00,BUFFETT," Well, we did it because  it's very hard to buy blocks  in the market of Berkshire.  We probably never see blocks except we do see them from  estates or occasionally.  But if somebody is going to sell 100 million shares,  100 million dollars worth of Berkshire and we want to buy it,  we'd like them to call us.  And if it's if it's if we're buying at that price level,  we'll be buying.  We'll buy it. "
316,1:23:01,1:23:04,SPEAKER 1," Dan Mahoney actually wrote in with a very similar question.  He just said, is it hard to buy back the shares? "
317,1:23:05,1:23:57,BUFFETT," It's harder to buy back Berkshire shares than,  say, Bank of America is buying back their shares.  Bank of America bought back eight or nine percent of their stock last year and they can really do it without moving the market.  I mean, Apple's been buying back a ton of stock.  They were buying stock at the same time we were buying stock.  But it was easier for us to buy Apple stock,  even though Apple itself was buying a lot of stock than it is to buy Berkshire.  Berkshire is,  well, it's held by people that really plan to keep it.  There's I think the amount of speculation in Berkshire stock is relatively low compared to most stocks.  And so it's it's it's it's  well, we bought five billion dollars worth last year,  but that's only one percent of the market cap.  And and I would say with a great many companies,  you can buy four or five percent of the company fairly easily a year without disturbing the market.  American Express has been buying it every year. "
318,1:23:58,1:24:05,SPEAKER 1," So with you putting out an ad in the letter to shareholders,  does that basically mean you are eager to buy more shares back? "
319,1:24:05,1:24:24,BUFFETT," Depends on the price.  But but we'll let anybody know if we told them to call us before the opening or after the close.  But but and only if only with blocks and only if they're ready to do business.  Now, there'll be a few people probably that probably try and call just to see whether we're buying or not.  We will we will not show a lot of patience with those people. "
320,1:24:24,1:24:36,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk about shares of Apple,  both from you just mentioning it with the share buybacks,  with it being such a huge holding of yours.  You've got more than five point three percent of the company right now. "
321,1:24:36,1:24:40,BUFFETT," I think five, six, but I went six and it goes up every day. "
322,1:24:40,1:24:59,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk about what we've seen with the slowdown with the coronavirus,  because Apple is one of the companies that has said it's going to have an impact not only with the stores that they've closed there with the behavior of Chinese customers,  but also what happens with the supply chain.  I change.  Sure.  How do you read through any of that?  What are you hearing?  Do you know more than we do on?  No,  no. "
323,1:24:59,1:25:31,BUFFETT," I don't know one thing more.  I see I may see Tim Cook at the annual meeting.  I see him in Sun Valley once a year.  No, I I don't think.  I don't think I've placed a phone call to Tim Cook in two or three years or I mean, no, I it  all kinds of things are going to happen to Apple over the next 10 years.  The real question is, is,  you know, what is the degree of pervasiveness and strength of that product five or 10 years from now?  And I don't think of Apple as a stock.  I think it's our third largest business. "
324,1:25:32,1:25:39,SPEAKER 1, It's also a high flying technology company.  It's one that's been at the forefront.  But you've said in the past you didn't buy it because it's a technology company.
325,1:25:39,1:25:43,BUFFETT," I think it's a consumer products.  In fact, I think I said this on the program a couple of years ago. "
326,1:25:43,1:25:44,SPEAKER 1," I mean, it is  obviously it's a consumer product company that uses technology,  but we've got a lot of products that use technology that at Berkshire.  But it's an incredible company.  And I should have appreciated it earlier.  There's a question that came in from I  guess the handle is GPG.  This is a question that came in on Twitter.  And the writer asks,  you've said that you can do fair value estimates of companies.  You follow it any time in your head.  So please do one now for Apple.  What went wrong with your estimate for IBM?  And how is that a miscalculation?  Different than for Apple?  Well,  IBM is an entirely different business than Apple.  I mean,  Apple doesn't resemble IBM anymore.  It resembles Seed Candy way more.  I mean, it is a incredibly useful product to people that grows more useful as the number of people are involved.  I mean,  it's really interesting.  You know, we call them smartphones.  If  you go back and look at the old telephone,  that was an incredible useful.  It changed my mother's life and my dad's.  It changed lives in every way.  And they they took a long time to become pervasive and it was very expensive initially.  But  it it changed the world.  And the smartphone is part of  hundreds and hundreds of millions of people's lives.  And all aspects of their lives that they it's used for as all kinds of utility.  It's a consumer product.  Are you a consumer of its products at this point?  You've had a flip phone for forever.  Ah,  I'm glad you brought that up.  I am now using not very often.  I'm using the latest model.  And I'll give you a little preview of our our movie for the annual meeting.  We haven't done it yet,  but it will probably showing me crushing with my foot,  my old flip phone while closing up to the new smartphone.  When did you get a smartphone? "
341,1:27:52,1:27:59,BUFFETT," I've been given several of them,  but including by Tim Cook. "
342,1:28:01,1:28:04,SPEAKER 1, One finally stuck.  What?  One finally stuck.  You're right.
343,1:28:04,1:28:11,BUFFETT," Yeah, absolutely.  No, I my flip phone is permanently gone.  The number's been changed to my new phone. "
344,1:28:11,1:28:12,SPEAKER 1," Yeah,  that's impressive. "
345,1:28:13,1:28:18,BUFFETT," I mean, you're looking at an eighty nine year old guy that's barely beginning to be with it. "
346,1:28:19,1:28:23,SPEAKER 1, What do you like best about the phone?  And what do you like least?
347,1:28:24,1:28:40,BUFFETT," Well, I don't I don't use all its facilities like most people.  I mean, most people are living their lives around it.  And I use it as a phone as a phone and I use it as a phone.  I don't like investment bankers talk about EBITDA,  which I translate as earnings.   That was Berkshire Hathaway,  vice chairman Charlie Munger,  about a week and a half ago when he was speaking at the annual shareholders meeting for his other company,  The Daily Journal, answering questions, giving his usual straight answers when things come up as questions.  Warren, that was Charlie talking about EBITDA earnings,  calling them B.S.  earnings, although he said it a little more more explicitly.  You in your shareholder letter for Berkshire Hathaway also wrote about how you don't believe in gap earnings.  What how do you guys come about this?  What do you think?  You still have to report these numbers,  but you're basically telling shareholders don't listen to them.  Well,  the the yeah, it's two different principles.  I mean, the gap numbers which show us earning 80 billion,  which is more than any company's ever earned in history.  And we explain why that really isn't the relevant statistic, because a lot of that was just the stock market going up,  which now gets counted in our earnings.  And Charlie was expressing an opinion we both have.  I'm sure Charlie is the shy,  reticent one of the pair.  But Charlie is the best partner anybody could possibly have.  We've been partners now for 60 years and you could not have a better partner.  He at 96,  a woman since that meeting, actually,  in the last couple of weeks,  a woman said to him, is it true, Mr.  Munger, that you have eight children?  And Charlie's reply was so far.  So Charlie, Charlie is very much  an active partner.  We'll put it that way.  Next time I see him,  I'll get an update on that. "
354,1:30:27,1:30:27,SPEAKER 1, Does he?
355,1:30:27,1:30:28,BUFFETT," So far, so far. "
356,1:30:28,1:30:40,SPEAKER 1," OK, let us know what happens.  Yeah, I will.  You know, we watch pretty closely Charlie shareholder meeting for The Daily Journal.  Sure.  We send cameras out.  We watch it.  I've been out myself.  Do you watch that meeting,  too, to see what he has? "
358,1:30:48,1:30:48,BUFFETT,"I watched it all on YouTube after afterwards.  But my sister and one of my good friends and my niece were all there. And and no, I end up  watching it.  And I actually end up reading it usually, too. And I wouldn't miss it.  But I don't go out for it."
362,1:30:57,1:31:01,SPEAKER 1, Was there anything he said that surprised you this time around?  And I'm just looking through some of his.
363,1:31:01,1:31:03,BUFFETT," Actually, nothing Charlie says can surprise me. "
364,1:31:04,1:31:08,SPEAKER 1, Is there anything that enlightened you or changed your opinion on something?  Maybe something.
365,1:31:08,1:31:33,BUFFETT," No, but I learned from Charlie every time I talk to him.  Charlie has the best 30 second mind in the world.  So I can go to him with a new question,  a new problem of any kind.  And it goes through about eight filters in his mind in in 10 seconds.  And he gets to the essence  of any problem.  There is nobody better to talk to than Charlie at age 96. "
366,1:31:35,1:31:42,SPEAKER 1," Is there anything you've talked to him about recently that you might be able to share?  I don't know if you want to share the conversations you guys have privately,  but anything where you bounce something off of him and he.  Well, I bounce. "
367,1:31:43,1:32:11,BUFFETT," I mean, we we talk about a lot of things and we talk a lot of we talk particularly about things we don't know the answer to.  And and,  you know, we find the whole scene  so interesting, whether it's politically or economically,  the world.  I mean, it it's incredibly interesting to us.  And and we're particularly interested in each other's view,  although I think I'm more interested in his view.  He is in mine.  And that would be a correct decision to make for somebody overhearing us. "
368,1:32:11,1:32:13,SPEAKER 1, What's something you guys don't understand right now?
370,1:33:15,1:33:15,BUFFETT,"Oh, we we do not understand at all  what the outcome will be  in a world where 13 trillion is being borrowed at less than zero.  And even Greece went on short term.  And I think Greece,  the 10 year bond is one percent, for example.  And and at the same time in this country,  we're having under very good business and market conditions,  we're having a four and a half percent  federal deficit and nobody is concerned in the least.  And we're talking about massive new programs and so on.  Everybody talks about  how they'll pay for them, but they really,  you know, the deficit is going to widen.  So we don't know what world comes out of something where you start with extremely low interest rates  and high rates of growth.  And then what you do for stimulus  later on.  But the whole game,  I mean, the game always unfolds differently than you expect. And and that's what makes it so interesting."
372,1:33:18,1:33:32,SPEAKER 1," You know, the 10 year speaking of these low rates just a little bit ago hit its lowest yield since July of 2016.  This morning, I think it was one point three,  seven, seven percent.  We're back at one point three,  nine, six percent, but 10 year rates below one point four percent.  You have anticipated this.  It makes no sense to lend money at one point four percent to the U.S.  government when it's government policy to change,  to have two percent a year inflation.  I mean, you've got you've got  the government is telling you we're going to give you one point four percent and tax you on it.  And on the other hand, we're going to  presumably devalue that money at two percent a year.  So these are very unusual conditions. And classical economics, it doesn't appear that,  you know, what do people do under such circumstances?  Everybody buy a mattress and stick their money under the mattress or what?  And it particularly seems  unusual when the world is generally prosperous.  And, you know, but that's the game is always changing,  but it always looks logical in retrospect.  And it always looks puzzling and prospectively.  But there's always things to do that make sense to like what?  Well, I hope that's what we're doing.  It's buying good businesses at decent prices,  whether all of the businesses or parts of the businesses through the stock market.  You know, you told me a year and a half ago,  maybe longer, that when you went out to try and buy whole businesses right now,  it just looks too expensive.  Which is why you started buying pieces of companies,  more stocks, but places like Apple.  Is that still the case?  Is it still a huge premium to try and buy a company outright? "
379,1:34:56,1:35:45,BUFFETT," There's quite a premium.  And part of the premium is because you can borrow so much money so cheap,  so cheaply in buying those businesses.  Obviously, you can pay more for a business if you can borrow a very high percentage of  the purchase price and of the future cash flow committed to it.  And you can borrow low rates with with very little in the way of restrictions,  restrictive covenants or anything of the sort.  I mean, that's going to bring higher prices.  And the demand for that is huge.  And people look at those rates on the 30 year,  the 10 year, and they say to themselves,  gee, I can't live on that.  And so they they stretch and buy poor credits.  But that's that's just part of the human cycle over time.  And that that leads to something else.  And that leads to something else.  In the end, if you own good businesses at the right price,  you're going to do fine. "
380,1:35:45,1:35:57,SPEAKER 1," You're often quoted as saying that you don't know who's skinny dipping until the tide goes out.  Who's swimming naked?  Yeah, I'd goes out.  I remember maybe you get the sense with a high tide right now that there's a lot of skinny. "
381,1:35:57,1:36:41,BUFFETT," Well, we're certainly doing.  We're allowing people to borrow money on much weaker terms  than we were five or 10 years  ago.  You couldn't borrow money at all or for a period of 10 years ago.  I mean, you literally you could.  Berkshire couldn't borrow money.  I mean, everything stopped.  And now we've the pendulum has  swung dramatically.  And yet we still have you know,  we have very, very, very low rates.  It's hard to believe that 10 years or 20 years from now,  we will have a substantial continuation of negative interest rates.  But I've already seen things I didn't think could happen.  Who knows what could happen?  That's what makes it interesting. "
382,1:36:41,1:37:12,SPEAKER 1," Let's get back out to Omaha,  where Becky Quick is with Warren Buffett.  And there's a lot of important things happening.  But don't forget that March Madness is right around the corner,  Becky.  And you should see what he's doing right now,  Joe.  He was rubbing his hands as you said that.  Now you're talking his language.  Now.  Well, Creighton, it was 70 to 35 at one point.  And I had Creighton yesterday.  I don't know if you were paying attention to that.  Were you watching that at all?  Warren?  Nebraska plays tonight. "
383,1:37:12,1:37:17,BUFFETT, We pay attention.  We pay attention to Creighton out here.
384,1:37:18,1:37:47,SPEAKER 1," They're good.  We talked about it earlier this morning.  Off camera.  I think they're peaking.  I mean, they're getting better and better and better.  The three point shooting was I think that one guy was seven for seven at one point yesterday, which is  I'd be like seven for  ten thousand for three pointers, I think.  Anyway, get back to business.  I just I'm looking forward to it,  Warren.  And I know we always have our own personal bet.  If I get them all right,  you give me Berkshire Hathaway,  which would be cool for me. "
385,1:37:49,1:37:54,BUFFETT," I'll tell you, if you get if you get it all the way,  I'll give you my Berkshire Hathaway shares all the way to the 64. "
386,1:37:55,1:37:57,SPEAKER 1, Wow.  Wow.
387,1:37:57,1:37:58,BUFFETT, A bracket.
388,1:37:58,1:38:05,SPEAKER 1," I got a pledge against that's the ultimate giving.  Yeah,  that's how sure he is that you won't be able to do it. "
389,1:38:06,1:38:06,BUFFETT, I'm pretty sure.
390,1:38:06,1:39:07,SPEAKER 1," Andrew, I hear you.  I hear you have a question to Andrew.  I have I actually have a couple.  And I thought that I read the letter like everybody else over the weekend.  It was fascinated by so many of your comments.  Warren, specifically, I wanted to ask you,  you talk about diversity on boards in this letter.  And one of the things I wanted you to weigh in on,  if you could, is I don't know if you saw,  but David Salomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,  on our air, actually announced a couple of weeks ago that he won't be taking any companies public.  Goldman won't unless they have at least one diverse board member and are likely going to push that to two.  You know, in the state of California,  they put a law into place saying that you needed to have a female board member.  And I'm curious what you think of not just the push towards more diversity on boards, but the requirement.  Because I also note in your letter that you have very specific thoughts about what it means to be a board member,  what it means to be an independent board member, how wealth  is involved in all of that.  What are your thoughts?  Well,  at Berkshire for decades,  we've given the three factors in addition to integrity,  but for board membership.  And we want people who are business savvy.  We want them to have a  strong personal interest in Berkshire itself.  And we've got directors who really represent shareholders,  basically, at Berkshire.  And I think they do a great job.  Now, that doesn't mean that they don't think that we should delight our customers,  that we should treat associates well,  that we should behave well in our community,  both local and national.  But  our directors represent the shareholders.  So  Warren, just to just to follow up on it, though,  what's your thought about both the requirement that maybe banks and others,  investors are going to force companies to have diverse candidates on their board laws,  as I mentioned, in California?  Yeah,  I actually there there may be there's been sent to us a proposal,  which unless it's withdrawn,  will be on our proxy.  I can't tell you precisely what it says,  but the relationship issue and we will get our shareholders view on it.  But I,  I personally and I want shareholders that I want directors that represent the shareholders.  And, you know,  in terms of my estate,  you know, with with  maybe currently 80 billion dollars worth of shares to give to philanthropy,  I hope that we have  a and we do have a group of directors that I think will be very conscious of doing the right thing.  The reason I ask the question is because the other point you made,  which I think is a very smart one and is often misconstrued in the corporate governance land,  is that an independent director these days isn't always independent in large part.  And you make the point that those that don't come to the table with some form of wealth often need the job.  They need the money.  They want the money.  And therefore, that makes them less independent.  And the reason I ask this is one of the things as we've been trying to get more diverse candidates on boards,  more women on boards,  as you know, there are there are there are fewer CEOs,  fewer people who have made enormous amounts of money and people therefore they can question their independence.  It becomes a very tricky issue.  And that's what I was hoping you might weigh in on. "
397,1:41:42,1:43:47,BUFFETT," Yeah, Andrew, I've been on 21 publicly owned boards of publicly owned companies and I've seen them in operation.  And I would say that  that people that I have often seen and that's perfectly understandable.  I have often seen people who are classified as independent directors and they are getting three hundred thousand dollars a year for a job that takes them  a couple of days,  maybe six times a year,  maybe four times a year.  And the company flies into their office and it's very enjoyable and the company's good.  And and who wouldn't want a job like that?  I mean, it's an incredible job.  And people I get calls from I get calls from headhunters.  I get calls from CEOs and they ask,  you know, who I think would make a quote good and quote director.  And what they are asking is,  you know, who is not going to cause too much trouble and who is going to reflect who their name is going to reflect credit on the institution.  And they are not looking for somebody that that that I would regard as really independent.  And I don't blame them.  I mean, if if if I had spent my life being,  you know, a teacher or whatever it might be,  I mean, my IQ is just as high as the average or higher than the people on the boards.  And all that.  But on the other hand,  I want to get on a board.  I mean, three hundred thousand bucks a year would look terrific.  And you don't even have to retire.  Probably in most cases,  a sixty five or anything of the sort.  So to call them independent is ridiculous.  And if you're if you're on one board like that,  you want to really go on another one and make six hundred thousand a year.  And you are not going to do things that irritate your president,  CEO.  So when he or she gets a call and says,  would this guy make a good director,  that the answer is no.  It's it's it's just ridiculous to ignore the factor of compensation with board members. "
398,1:43:48,1:44:18,SPEAKER 1," OK,  all right, let me let me ask a follow up question that is similarly related.  Warren, and that's just having to do with sustainability,  all these issues that are out there,  guys in the control room.  Sorry, this is not where I told you I was going.  But Abhishek Bhojra wrote in a question.  He said Larry Fink recently said that our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate integrated portfolios can provide better risk adjusted return to investors.  What's your view on sustainable investing? "
399,1:44:19,1:44:53,BUFFETT," Well, I don't happen to make that decision when I'm  buying stocks in our portfolio.  I'm I what their individual policies are.  I think they're all pro social.  I mean, obviously,  you've got to be in tune with your society.  But if you if you think that I look down at a bunch of stocks and decide whether to buy Apple or whether to buy J.P.  Morgan or I am not I'm not using the the factors and and the delays out. "
400,1:44:53,1:45:28,SPEAKER 1," OK,  I want to run through a series of questions that have been in.  These are kind of all over the map.  So forgive me, we'll bounce around.  But these are questions that came in from viewers that I thought were good ones.  Lucas writes in, he said, did Justin Sun change your mind on cryptocurrency?  For anybody who doesn't know,  Justin Sun bought the dinner or the lunch that you just had from the last Glide Foundation fundraiser.  He is actively involved in Bitcoin.  After that meeting,  his PR people put out some notes saying that, you know,  you kind of listen to cryptocurrency and maybe you're a little more in tune with the idea of Bitcoin now.   Well, I would say this when Justin and four friends came,  they behaved perfectly and we had a good three and a half hour dinner.  And the whole thing was a very friendly exchange of ideas.  But cryptocurrency is basically have no value and they don't produce anything.  So you can look at your little ledger item for the next 20  years and it says you've got X of this cryptocurrency or that it doesn't reproduce.  It doesn't it doesn't deliver.  It can't mail you a check.  It can't do anything.  And what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for it later on.  But then that person's got the problem.  But in terms of value,  you know, zero.  So it sounds like he did not change your position. "
405,1:46:09,1:46:25,BUFFETT," No, but I didn't change his either.  And I had a very pleasant dinner.  And those people were,  they behaved more than well.  And they gave four point six or Justin gave four point six million to Glide.  And that will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco.  So I thank him. "
406,1:46:26,1:46:28,SPEAKER 1, He gave you some Bitcoin.  What's it feel like to be a Bitcoin?
407,1:46:28,1:46:32,BUFFETT, I don't have any Bitcoin.
408,1:46:33,1:46:39,SPEAKER 1," You don't?  No.  OK.  No, you don't own Bitcoin. "
409,1:46:39,1:46:44,BUFFETT," No, I do not own one.  I don't own any cryptocurrency.  I never will. "
410,1:46:45,1:46:45,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, in the end,  I may start a war on currency.  You know, maybe I can create one and I'll say there's only gonna be 21 million of them.  And you can have a little ledger sheet from me and everything that says you have it.  And and you're going to have it after I die.  And but you can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.  And the interesting thing,  of course, is that  Bitcoin's been out there a long time and people  talked about how it would be used and in various kinds of  exchange.  But  none of our companies are doing business in in Bitcoin or anything.  Yeah. "
415,1:47:17,1:47:27,BUFFETT," Bitcoin has been used, I think,  to move around a fair amount of money illegally.  So the the  people in countries where you.  Yeah.  So the logical move from the introduction of Bitcoin is to go short suitcases  because the money that was taken in suitcases from one country to another suitcases will probably fall off in demand.  I mean, so you can look at that as the economic contribution of Bitcoin to the society is. "
418,1:47:48,1:48:10,SPEAKER 1," All right.  Let's talk about a question that comes in from Rusty Thomas.  And he has he's got a question on baseball.  He said, given Warren's love of baseball and the contrast between his deft management of the Solomon Brothers scandal and Major League Baseball's inexplicable mismanagement of the Astros sign stealing debacle.  What advice would Warren provide MLB Commissioner Manfred to restore confidence and integrity in the game? "
419,1:48:10,1:48:28,BUFFETT," Yeah, well,  it survived the Black Sox scandal back around 1920 and people will continue to love baseball.  But, you know,  it was one thing to steal signs if you were on second base.  But it's bad.  Baseball will get past this. "
420,1:48:29,1:48:34,SPEAKER 1, You're a huge baseball fan.  Were you?  Pardon me?  You're a huge baseball fan.  Were you surprised to hear about?
421,1:48:34,1:48:35,BUFFETT," Yeah, I was surprised to hear about it. "
422,1:48:36,1:48:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
423,1:48:36,1:49:03,BUFFETT," But then I find out that Bobby Thompson's home.  You know,  somebody stole the sign,  I think, off Ralph Brank or somebody.  You know, so people are going to in any games,  including the stock market game,  you know, a certain number of people cheat.  And and generally we have people that administer things to try and minimize the cheating.  And and I'm sure that Major League Baseball will  will address the problem. "
424,1:49:03,1:49:05,SPEAKER 1, Should the Astros players get off scot-free?
425,1:49:05,1:49:12,BUFFETT," Oh, I'm not going to make a judgment on that.  But Joe Jackson certainly didn't. "
426,1:49:13,1:49:37,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me ask you about a question that came in from several viewers,  actually.  And that's about ETFs.  DeMosley Management wrote this version of the question.  And news agencies have reported that Berkshire Hathaway purchased two ETFs.  So can you talk about if this purchase happened and if the purchase happened,  who purchased the ETF for Berkshire Hathaway?  And how was the decision made to purchase it?  Yeah, it wasn't me.  It wasn't me or it wasn't Todd or it wasn't Ted.  And it happened in some pension fund. And we have a few pension funds that aren't actually managed by us.  But I all I can tell you is that nobody had  nobody that manages money at Berkshire is buying ETFs,  nor do I see any possibility that they will.  Another purchase that came up recently,  Kroger and Jason Escamilla writes in.  Was that one of yours or a lieutenant's pick? "
431,1:50:05,1:50:06,BUFFETT, It was one of the others.
432,1:50:08,1:50:08,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, I know Kroger.  Kroger's done a good job,  but it's in a very tough business.  I mean, when you have  when you have Amazon and  Walmart slugging it out and Costco taking a special part of it and everything,  it's a tough business,  but they've done a good job.  And and one of our managers decided to buy that. And then Kraft Heinz.  This comes in from David Hall.  He says, Mr.  Buffett, while Kraft Heinz continues to whittle down their total debt,  do you feel that the current dividend payout is appropriate  or should it be reduced further to free up more cash flow to reduce debt more rapidly?  Now, I think Kraft Heinz should pay down its debt.  And it should."
439,1:50:48,1:51:12,BUFFETT," But I think under present circumstances,  it appears that it can pay the dividend and pay down debt at a reasonable rate.  And it has too much debt,  but it doesn't have some it doesn't have debt.  It can't pay down.  And the the debt holders are going to get the interest and the debt should come down year by year.  And I think it will.  And I think it can with the present dividend.  But who knows for sure in the future? "
440,1:51:13,1:51:18,SPEAKER 1," Theo Phelos writes in a similar question and says,  do you still believe in the company and management? "
441,1:51:18,1:51:33,BUFFETT," It's still a great business in the sense that it earns,  we'll say, five billion dollars after depreciation pre-tax on seven billion of tangible assets.  It uses about seven billion of fixed assets.  It has no working out. "
442,1:51:33,1:51:33,SPEAKER 1," I mean,  it's a very valuable business.  But we paid too much for for Kraft and we we took on more debt than that.  And but we paid too much.  Another question comes in from Beale again on Kraft Heinz.  And this person writes in private labels have performed very well against brands like Kraft Heinz,  but they haven't made a dent against other brands like Coca-Cola or C's.  Why do you think that is?  And how do you think about brands modes,  given your experience with Kraft? "
445,1:52:02,1:53:45,BUFFETT," Brands are always going to be in a fight with the retailer and.  And it varies by country enormously,  it varies by product category.  If people worked in a grocery store in 1941,  Charlie worked in state one in 1940,  people would call and they'd ask for a can of peas and I'd write down a can of peas.  They'd call it and they'd ask for  Heinz ketchup.  And I better get give them Heinz ketchup.  They didn't care which brand the peas were.  They didn't care that much whether the two quarts of milk we sent them were this brand or that brand.  But they cared whether it was it was it was Heinz ketchup.  That was 1941.  Some brands are terribly strong.  You can't bring out a a private label call and do very well with it.  And people have tried for a long,  long time.  On the other hand,  you can bring up private labels and lots of products and and they sell very well.  And, you know, you take  Costco with their own Kirkland label.  I mean, that that label grows dramatically.  It cuts across categories.  It it it, you know, it it's done since 1992 or whenever it was introduced.  Do what other people spent a hundred years,  you know, with huge amounts of advertising and special display,  all kinds of things.  So the battle goes on.  I would say that the retailer has gained ground against brands to some degree.  But brands are still terribly important.  I mean, try and give me a 10 billion dollar budget and ask me to bring out another Coca-Cola that makes a dent in Coca-Cola.  And I can't do it. "
446,1:53:45,1:54:04,SPEAKER 1," Warren, one of the questions that did come in,  it was something that you wrote about in the annual letter,  was the role that Greg and Ajit play.  Greg Abel, Ajit Jain, the two vice chairman who were recently added as vice chairman,  the role that they're going to be playing in the annual meeting with shareholders.  You said that they will play a larger role in the shareholder meeting.  How will that work? "
447,1:54:04,1:54:34,BUFFETT," Well, it will mean that any shareholder or any of the journalists there who are presenting questions from shareholders that have been sent to them can direct those questions to either Ajit or to Greg.  So if they were insurance questions,  they might want to direct them to Ajit,  not insurance questions to Greg.  But they will be there  and we'll have 60 or so questions.  We don't know what they're going to be.  And if anybody says,  I would like Greg to answer this or I would like Ajit to answer this,  then they're right there adjacent to us. "
448,1:54:34,1:54:36,SPEAKER 1, They'll be sitting on stage with you and Charlie?
449,1:54:36,1:54:42,BUFFETT," Well, there's this.  Yeah, there's there's somebody sitting in front of the crowd.  There's two different levels of tears there.  Yeah. "
450,1:54:43,1:54:52,SPEAKER 1," Again, you said you did this because you'd gotten a lot of questions from directors,  shareholders,  other people who had kind of advised you that they thought it was good for them to be playing a bigger role. "
451,1:54:52,1:55:05,BUFFETT, Everybody I heard from quite a few people now we directed questions out to them where they were sitting with the directors out in front.  Then the spotlight went down.  But this may encourage more questions directly of them.  And that'll be terrific.
452,1:55:06,1:55:17,SPEAKER 1," OK.  Jim Bean writes in a question,  he says, in the past, both you and Bill Gates have stated that half of the board meetings are spent discussing succession.  How has this changed since Ajit and Greg are on the board?  Do they leave the room? "
453,1:55:18,1:55:54,BUFFETT," They leave the room.  But  if I die tonight,  the board tomorrow morning knows exactly what they're going to do.  I hope they're polite about it,  let the body cool off.  Basically, they know what they're going to do.  And the interesting thing about it is  we own, you know, the Apple and JP Morgan,  all those things.  I don't know who's going to succeed the CEOs of  any of the companies.  I think that we own stock.  But we're well prepared for succession.  It's almost going to be embarrassing.  All right. "
454,1:55:54,1:56:07,SPEAKER 1," Let's get to a few more shareholder questions.  Chip Crook writes in a note and says it was reported that Boeing was looking for a large cash  loan.  Were you ever approached about Berkshire loaning the money,  kind of like the Goldman Sachs  deal from years ago? "
455,1:56:08,1:56:12,BUFFETT," I think I think Boeing's raised about 13 billion,  but that's bank type  money.  In other words, my memory is that it's maybe 1 percent.  They're looking for they're looking for traditional bank loans and we don't make traditional bank loans. "
458,1:56:24,1:56:44,SPEAKER 1," You also talked in the letter about how Berkshire Hathaway has Berkshire  Hathaway Energy, I should say, has the ability and the talent to manage big investments,  100 billion dollars and more.  I think you wrote,  we stand ready and willing and able on such opportunities.  California Governor Gavin Newsom asked you at one point to bid on PG&E.  Is that such an opportunity? "
459,1:56:45,1:57:09,BUFFETT," PG&E, we've obviously I mean,  we've worked with them for decades and been familiar with them.  But but  that doesn't that doesn't fit Berkshire.  But if there were 100 billion of transmission lines or whatever it might be,  Berkshire could do it.  I mean, and we would love it.  That happens to be a very tough thing to do because you cross all these states and everybody says not in my backyard and all that. "
460,1:57:09,1:57:09,SPEAKER 1," But  but there can be huge,  intelligent investment  made in the utility energy area and no one is better equipped to do it than Berkshire in both talent and resources.  Why does PG&E not fit that bill?  It's too tough.  I don't know the answer to it.  I mean, that rearranging that utility,  I think I know Governor Newsom.  I think he's a very,  very, very smart guy.  And in terms of  solving this problem, it's just not easy.  You've got so many constituencies and they're at each other's throats and there's lots of money involved. And"
465,1:57:46,1:57:50,BUFFETT, I don't want to be the guy.  I don't know how to solve all that.
466,1:57:50,1:58:14,SPEAKER 1," OK, let's go on to a question that is posed by Ken Ducey.  He says you sold 31 newspapers after buying them over 40 years as a self-described newspaper addict.  You said recently that most newspapers were toast.  I know that's not exactly that's not true.  This isn't his question.  You can answer that.  Yeah.  Do you believe the problem with local newspapers is a lack of demand or a lack of innovation and a new business model? "
467,1:58:14,1:59:31,BUFFETT," Well, the problem is that,  well, getting back to the toast comment,  Andy Shoreware actually is the fellow who said toast.  He was interviewing me and I repeated it.  But the the problem is even every day,  the circulation of the papers in every every print circulation goes down.  And the interesting thing about it,  of course, is that the three survivors so far that look promising online are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.  All three of those papers  sold their smaller papers.  The New York Times sold,  I think, 11 papers  about seven or eight years ago.  The Dow Jones, which owned The Wall Street Journal and now is owned by News Corp,  they sold the Ottawa newspapers, eight papers.  Washington Post sold the Epoch Tarot.  So they all saw the handwriting on the wall before I did.  And they all sold their papers.  That was their reaction.  They did not they did not try and figure out the online solutions.  They got out of them.  And unfortunately, I bought some and we're still in.  I mean, we are financing Lee and we think Lee has by far the best opportunity  to continue print as long as anybody and to find an online solution for these papers.  So we put new money into the newspaper industry here or we've committed to do it. "
468,1:59:31,1:59:44,SPEAKER 1," It will close in a month or two.  And then finally, very quickly, we are in the Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters  building here in Omaha.  Strom writes in a question,  says, why did you decide to rent your offices for all these  years instead of buying the building or building your own office building? "
469,1:59:44,1:59:54,BUFFETT," Well, we only use one floor of the 15 floors here,  but we have signed a lease for the  next 20 years on one more floor.  So it shows just how flexible our thinking is about the future. "
470,1:59:54,1:59:56,SPEAKER 1, How much growth you're anticipating?
471,1:59:56,2:00:04,BUFFETT," Yeah, we don't want a big headquarters office.  If we had a big headquarters office,  we'd fill it.  Believe me, I mean, if we had 15 floors of our own,  we'd have 15 floors worth of people. "
472,2:00:06,2:00:22,SPEAKER 1," Warren, before we let you go,  let's just go back to the futures again this morning,  because right now the Dow is indicated to open down about 100 or 830 points.  Weakness again on concerns about coronavirus and what that means.  What's your mentality today as you kind of go out and look at the stock market and decide what you're going to do? "
473,2:00:23,2:00:33,BUFFETT, We're buying businesses to own for 20 or 30 years.  We buy them in whole.  We buy them in part.  They're called stocks when we buy them in part.  And we think the 20 and 30 year outlook has not changed by coronavirus.
474,2:00:34,2:00:40,SPEAKER 1," All right,  Warren, I want to thank you for your time today.  We really appreciate it.  Your generosity with your time.  And we hope to see you again soon. "
475,2:00:41,2:00:42,BUFFETT, Come every year.
476,2:00:42,2:00:42,SPEAKER 1, Thank you.
