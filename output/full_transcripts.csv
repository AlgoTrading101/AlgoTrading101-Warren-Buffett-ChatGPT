0,0:00:00,0:01:00,SPEAKER 2," Warren Buffett needs little introduction.  He's the godfather of modern-day investing.  For nearly 50 years,  Buffett has run Berkshire Hathaway,  which owns over 60 companies like GEICO and Dairy Queen,  plus minority stakes in Apple,  Coca-Cola and many others.  His $82.5 billion fortune makes him the third  richest person in the world,  and he's vowed to give nearly all of it away.  The Oracle of Omaha is here to talk about what shaped his investment strategy and how to master today's market.  I'm Andy Serwer.  Welcome to a special edition of Influencers from Omaha,  Nebraska.  It's my pleasure to welcome Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.  Warren, welcome. "
1,0:01:00,0:01:01,BUFFETT, Thanks for coming.
2,0:01:01,0:01:08,SPEAKER 2," So let's start off and talk about the economy a little bit.  And obviously we've been on a good long run here.   A very long run.  And yet, does that surprise you?  And what would be the signs that you would look for to see that things were winding down?"
3,0:01:16,0:02:01,BUFFETT," Well, I look at a lot of figures just in connection with our businesses.  I like to get numbers.  So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses.  But that doesn't tell me what the economy is going to do six months from now or three months from now.  It tells me what's going on now with our businesses.  And it really doesn't make any difference  in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses,  what those numbers tell me.  They're interesting,  but they're not guidance to me.  If we buy a business,  we're going to hold it forever.  So we're going to have good years,  bad years, in between years, maybe a disastrous year, some year.  And we care a lot about the price.  We do not care about the next 12 months. "
4,0:02:02,0:02:06,SPEAKER 2, But are you surprised at how long this economy has been expanding?
5,0:02:06,0:03:29,BUFFETT," I've been surprised by all kinds of things in the last 10 years about the economy.  I mean, I don't think there was  any economist I've ever read that  talked about negative interest rates for long periods of time.  I mean, if you go back and read Keynes or you  read Samuelson, you read any of them, they do not  get into a negative rate  environment.  I think now there's still $11 trillion of government debt around the world that's at  a negative rate.  So  we've never seen it before.  And we've never seen at least the conventional  wisdom on a sustained period of  long and growing deficits while the economy is getting better,  extremely low interest rates,  and really very little inflation.  So something different is happening,  but something different happens all the time.  And that's one reason economic predictions just don't enter into our decisions.  Charlie Munger, my partner, and I,  in 54 years now,  we've never made a decision based on an economic prediction.  We make business predictions about what individual businesses will do over time.  And we compare that to what we have to pay for.  But we have never said yes to something because we thought  the economy was going to do well in the next year or two years.  And we've never said no to anything because we were right in the middle of a panic even if the price was right.   All right.  So you don't pay much attention to the dismal scientists then, I guess.  Well,  I pay none in the sense of as a guideline to doing anything.  It's entertainment.  I mean, you know, it's like going to a variety show or something like that.  But  I just don't know  of any economist that  actually has  bought businesses successfully or done well in stocks.  Paul Samuelson did.  And you may know he was a big shareholder at Berkshire.  But  it's,  you know, they make guesses.  And there's so many variables.  I mean, in the hard sciences,  you know that  if an apple falls from a tree,  that it isn't going to change over the centuries because of anything or political developments or 400  other variables that go in.  But when you get into economics, there's so many variables. And the truth is you've got to expect good times and bad times  in business.  And if you were to buy an auto dealership and you're,  you know, wherever you live locally or a McDonald's franchise or anything like that,  you wouldn't try and time the purchase.  You try and make the right purchase at the right price and you want to be sure you got a good business.  But you wouldn't say I'm going to buy it because  growth this year is going to be 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent or something.  Fair enough."
6,0:04:54,0:04:57,SPEAKER 2, You have over a hundred billion dollars of cash.
7,0:04:57,0:04:58,BUFFETT, Berkshire does.
8,0:04:58,0:05:14,SPEAKER 2," Berkshire.  I don't even see how much you got.  Maybe you do.  Berkshire has over a hundred billion in cash.  And you say that you always want this company to be a fortress.  So how much cash should an ordinary investor have on a percentage basis,  do you think? "
9,0:05:14,0:05:18,BUFFETT," It depends on a personal situation.  If you're working in something where you're not a big investor,  you're not going to have a lot of cash.  If you're working in something where you're living off your paycheck from  week to week, you want to have a little cash around.  And you certainly don't want to have a credit card that's maxed out or anything like that.  But if,  you know, if your house is paid off,  if you don't have big living expenses,  you got a portfolio of decent, diversified businesses,  you  don't really need any cash. "
10,0:05:46,0:05:51,SPEAKER 2, So you can be more cash free than Berkshire is.
11,0:05:52,0:06:28,BUFFETT," Yeah.  Yeah.  I've got responsible, you know, we've got insurance claims.  We could have hurricanes that,  you know, would happen.  All kinds of things where you might have to pay out billions of dollars.  And I've got over a million people that own  shares that are counting to run the place.  So we get through periods like that.  But if I were retired, I had to  say a million dollar  portfolio stocks that was paying me 30 ,000 a year in dividends or something of the sort.  And my children had been growing,  the house was paid off and everything.  I wouldn't worry too much about having a lot of cash around. "
12,0:06:29,0:06:44,SPEAKER 2," Let's talk a little bit about Apple.  Everyone always wants to talk about Apple,  right?  It's kind of the it stock, it company.  You have a 45 billion dollar stake,  more or less.  How closely do you follow the company?  You know, people are concerned they haven't really introduced any new products. "
13,0:06:45,0:06:48,BUFFETT," Well, if you have to closely follow a company,  you shouldn't own it. "
14,0:06:48,0:06:48,SPEAKER 2," Really?   No.  I mean, if you buy a business,  if you buy a farm,  you know, you go up and look,  you know, every couple of weeks to see how far the corn is up.  And, you know, you worry too much about whether somebody says this is going to be a year of low prices because  exports are being affected or anything like that.  You know,  you buy a farm and you hold  it for, I've got one farm that I bought in the 1980s and my son runs it.  But  I've been there once,  you know, I mean, it doesn't grow faster if I go and stare at it.  You know, I can't cheer for it, you know,  more effort, more effort or something like that.  And I know there's going to be some years when prices are going to be good and some when the prices  aren't going to be good.  I know there's years when yields will be better than others.  But it's all about the farm.  And if  it just doesn't,  I don't care about economic predictions on  or anything of the sort.  I do care that over,  over the years it's well tended to in terms  of rotating crops.  And I hope yields get better,  which they generally have.  In fact,  that farm a hundred years ago would have probably produced  30 bushels,  maybe 35 bushels of corn per acre.  And  now in a good year,  you know, it'd be 200.  I mean,  we've really made progress in this country.  That's one reason commodity prices go back a couple hundred years.  They've moved so little is because we've just gotten better and better at  whether it's  cotton or whether it's corn or soybeans or all kinds of things.  And you and I have benefited from that.  And so Apple is kind of like a farm."
15,0:08:19,0:08:34,BUFFETT," Well, it's a long term investment.  And if you owned the best auto dealership in town,  the best brand and had somebody good running it,  you wouldn't drop by every day and say,  you know, how many people have come in today? "
16,0:08:35,0:08:35,SPEAKER 2," Or,  you know, I think interest rates are going up a little.  Maybe we'll slow down our sales or anything.  You  buy it knowing there's 365 days a year and you're going to own it for 20 years.  So that's 7300 days.  And, you know, they're going to things are going to be different from day to day and year to year.  You shouldn't buy it at the day to day stuff is important.  Let's switch over to talk about buybacks,  which is another hot topic these days.  And and you did a fair amount.  If you look in the annual report,  you can see that between December 13th and 24th,  it looks like you guys bought back about two hundred and thirty three million dollars worth of Berkshire,  which was right near that particular stock market bottom.  How did you know that?  What was going through your mind? "
17,0:09:21,0:09:58,BUFFETT," If I knew it,  I'd have bought a lot more than 200.  Now, that's not a big purchase for us, actually.  And now we will buy Berkshire when we have lots of excess cash.  All the needs of the business are taken care of.  We spent 14 billion dollars on property,  plant and equipment last year,  way more than depreciation.  So we take care of the needs of the business.  Then we have excess cash.  And if we find invest,  we'd love to do is find other businesses to buy.  But if our stock,  if I think the stock and my partner,  Charlie Munger, think the stock is selling  below intrinsic business value,  we will buy in stock. "
18,0:09:58,0:10:00,SPEAKER 2, So it obviously was at that point.
19,0:10:01,0:10:31,BUFFETT," Well,  we thought so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But but,  you know, what's really intriguing is when it goes down a lot.  I mean, when when you're buying dollar bills for for 60 or 70 cents,  which periodically you get a chance to do in stocks,  then, you know, assuming you've got the cash,  you don't want to ever get so that that some some surprise could really take you out in some way.  But if we've got excess cash,  we'll buy as fast as we can. "
20,0:10:31,0:10:35,SPEAKER 2," But at that point,  it would be more like a 2009 rather than just December. "
21,0:10:36,0:10:50,BUFFETT," Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But it's,  you know, if you and I own a McDonald's franchise together and it's worth a million dollars and you own 50 percent of it,  you come to me and you say I'll sell out for four hundred thousand,  you know, I'll buy out. "
22,0:10:50,0:10:55,SPEAKER 2," You say you want to buy mine.  I'd be wary of that.  But yeah, for just that reason, you should be.  Yeah. "
23,0:10:56,0:10:59,BUFFETT," But you want six hundred thousand dollars,  you'll say come back tomorrow. "
24,0:10:59,0:11:22,SPEAKER 2," So just continuing about buybacks,  Senator Schumer's and Sanders want the government to weigh in to sort of legislate when companies can do buybacks.  And then also there was a report recently about executives doing insider trading, it appears,  around the times of buyback.  So are buybacks a kind of a problem?  Well,  you'll have some people that misbehave and respect them,  any activity.  I mean, so it really wouldn't have much to do with buybacks.  I think buybacks,  the degree to which they've been part of nefarious activity,  and I've observed them for a lot of years,  are very close to zero."
25,0:11:39,0:11:39,BUFFETT," But  that just may be that there aren't enough opportunities.  But  that article did not,  I didn't follow the conclusion on it.  I mean, you're distributing money to shareholders, essentially.  You can do it by dividends.  And presumably American business should distribute money  to its owners occasionally.  And we do it through buybacks.  We've done some.  And we don't do it through dividends.  But most companies do it through having a dividend policy.  And then if they have money beyond the needs of the business,  then I think if their stock is underpriced,  then it makes nothing but sense. "
26,0:12:18,0:12:23,SPEAKER 2, Should the government tell companies  when to do it or at least mandate conditions where they can?
27,0:12:24,0:13:22,BUFFETT," Well, they do restrict you a little in terms  of if you're some general rule of the SEC,  if you're having some kind of,  this isn't quite the right word,  but manipulative activity or anything like that in the stock.  But no,  I don't think the government should decide your dividend policy.  I don't even think they  should direct your capital investments.  They can make it enticing to make certain kinds of  capital investments, which they do with  renewable energy, for example.  I mean, the government has interest in fostering certain developments in this country over time.  And they do,  there used to be a special oil depletion allowance,  you know, 50 years ago and so on.  That was more politics than it was governmental policy.  But certainly renewables are a prime example of that.  But the idea of directing whether you are entitled to return cash to  shareholders and the manner in which you do it,  I don't think really makes a lot of sense. "
28,0:13:23,0:13:33,SPEAKER 2," The 2020 election is going to be upon us before we know it.  And I know that you had some nice things to say about Mike Bloomberg,  but it appears he is not going to be running now. "
29,0:13:33,0:13:35,BUFFETT," Yeah, it's hard to win with just a billionaire vote. "
30,0:13:37,0:13:39,SPEAKER 2, You would have your vote and a few others.  That's funny.
31,0:13:40,0:13:44,BUFFETT, But I admire him enormously.  I wish he had run.  I want to be very clear on that.
32,0:13:45,0:13:57,SPEAKER 2," President Trump was a business executive.  So two questions.  Is a business executive the right kind of person to be president?  And what characteristics do you look for for a president that you would support?  Well,  I think  a business executive can be the right person.  But I don't think that because they're a business executive that you give them extra points.  And number one, I want a president that wakes up every morning and realizes that the greatest threat to a country,  which has got all kinds of things going for it,  are weapons of mass destruction.  And that we live in a world where people,  organizations,  and occasionally countries could have people that would like to wipe out a large percentage of the American people or maybe other  countries as well.  And that you now have capabilities,  which I always thought,  until recently, I classified as nuclear, chemical, and biological.  But I think you have to add cyber now.  If  you have some evil genius someplace that,  for  crazy reasons, just like  happened with anthrax back,  who knows what motivates somebody that starts sending  anthrax out in their letters.  And if you have somebody that thinks it'd be great to send a false alarm to the Russians and  to the US that the other side was launching or something of the sort,  it's a very, very dangerous world.  It's a wonderful world,  but it has dangers now that started in August  of 1945 and when Einstein said,  you know, this changes everything in the world except  how men think.  And  so I want a president that has that same filter that  all of these other things are important,  but  protecting the country and reducing the chance of successful use of weapons of mass destruction against us  is the number one job.  And I think  most of the presidents,  I've talked to a couple of them about it over the years, and I  really think that they do realize that they may get lost in the events of every day as they go along.  And then beyond that,  I want a president that  has two objectives with the economy.  One is to make sure that this marvelous goose we have keeps laying more golden eggs.  And then I want a president that also feels that if GDP is $60 ,000 per capita in the United States,  that nobody should get left behind.  We've got a market system that works marvelously in turning out more goods and services, better ones  year after year, done it all through my life.  Would you ever talk to a candidate and say, hey,  what do you think about these three things? "
33,0:16:32,0:16:53,BUFFETT," Well,  they'll tell me what I want to hear.  So I want to hear what they tell people who disagree with them on the subject.  I always like to ask a candidate.  They usually finesse me somewhere.  But I say, what are you for that the majority of your followers are against?  You know, I know you really believe in that.  And that's really the test. "
34,0:16:53,0:16:53,SPEAKER 2, But
35,0:16:54,0:16:59,BUFFETT," I'm not sure that except under some kind of sodium  peddle or something, you're going to get a great answer. "
36,0:16:59,0:17:04,SPEAKER 2, That's great.  But that's the question you ask the presidential candidates  or presidents that you would speak to.
37,0:17:04,0:17:31,BUFFETT," If  I really want to get,  and that's why Bernie Sanders was  so successful.  I mean, 90% of the people who voted for Bernie Sanders  had probably not heard of him two years earlier.  But they felt, they knew exactly what they wanted.  They felt they knew exactly what he would do.  I mean, they felt he was authentic.  And if you asked him what he was for that most people might be against,  he would tell you. "
38,0:17:32,0:17:38,SPEAKER 2, A few questions about Kraft Heinz.  Was that a mistake?
39,0:17:38,0:19:13,BUFFETT," Well, we'll find out over time.  But we did pay too much,  in my view, for Kraft.  We didn't pay too much for Heinz.  So when we started out,  it was originally a non-public  partnership between us.  But we did pay too much, in my view,  for Kraft.  And there's not much you can do about things if you pay too much.  And secondly,  there's always been a struggle between the retailer and brands.  I mean, if I've got a terribly weak brand  and I want to get into Walmart,  I'm not going to be able to do it.  I mean,  that's all for all kinds of crazy concessions.  And I want to be in Walmart if I have some sort of  consumer packaged goods.  The negotiation is way different if you have something essential versus non-essential.  Ten years ago, Costco tried to get rid of Coca-Cola.  Costco's got terrific loyalty among customers.  And their own Kirkland brand is a $39 billion brand now.  And it moved from category to category.  And they only started in 1992.  So they know brands.  But in the end,  they put Coca-Cola back in.  If it had been Royal Crown Cola,  they wouldn't have had  to put it back in.  So there's always that struggle between the brands.  And there always will be.  But the retailer's net,  it has been moving in their direction,  particularly,  I think,  because of the Amazon revolution. "
40,0:19:14,0:19:15,SPEAKER 2, First Walmart and then...
41,0:19:15,0:19:16,BUFFETT," Oh, yeah, Walmart. "
42,0:19:16,0:19:17,SPEAKER 2," Walmart,  yeah. "
43,0:19:18,0:19:49,BUFFETT," But it's been accentuated.  I think  we have a new retailing environment now.  I mean, it is like it goes from night to day,  but it moves somewhat.  And brands that people have spent  billions of dollars developing  and sponsoring TV shows or sponsoring radio shows in the old days.  Campbell's Soup was always on there with Jack Benny or something,  you know, when I was a kid.  And it was big.  And it built brands.  And people obviously like the product, too. "
44,0:19:50,0:19:50,SPEAKER 2," But  people are more willing to change.  And it's harder.  It's a  somewhat different world.  It is night and day.  I mean, you are very unlikely to keep changing brands every day.  But it really surprised me that Gillette lost position.  Men don't like to experiment much.  Women are better at experimenting.  But  if a kid,  when you were a kid,  Gillette Cavalcade of Sports was your pal and brought  you the Rose Bowl and the World Series and all that sort of thing,  you didn't...  You'd just shave with Gillette the rest of your life.  And you still do to a great degree.  But it's not exactly the same as it was  even five years ago or so when we bought Kraft.  You mentioned Amazon as a game changer.  And I have to ask you,  you haven't bought the stock.  You're an admirer of Jeff Bezos.  A listing of the richest people in America came out.  He's number one.  I think your friend Bill Gates is number two.  You're number three.  So you can see what he's done in myriad ways.  And of course, the question is,  how come you haven't bought Amazon?  Is there still time to buy?  Would you still buy? "
45,0:21:01,0:21:59,BUFFETT," I always admired Jeff.  I mean, I met him 20 years ago or so.  And  I thought he was something special.  But I didn't realize you could go from books to what's happened there.  I mean, he had a vision and executed it in an incredible way.  Something that...  But there's a lot of games I miss.  I would have missed Microsoft even if I'd gotten to know Bill earlier.  Those just aren't my games.  I don't worry about the things I miss that are outside my circle of competence  of evaluating.  I have missed things that are within my circle.  And that's a terrible mistake.  Those are my biggest mistakes.  You haven't seen them.  But I don't...  It's not a mistake because I miss Netscape or something like that at all.  I would say that maybe 5% of the companies or 10% of the companies at most are within an area of my circle of competence.  There's something I should be able to understand. "
46,0:22:01,0:22:16,SPEAKER 2," All right.  Well, let me switch gears then and ask you about leverage a little bit.  And  corporate debt people are concerned about.  People are concerned about federal debt at $22 trillion.  Should we reduce,  let's just say, the federal debt?  And how would we do that? "
47,0:22:16,0:22:59,BUFFETT," Well,  if you're running a deficit getting close to 5%  when things are really good,  that's a new world.  And neither the Republicans or Democrats are particularly concerned about it.  And we're not having a lot of inflation.  That wasn't supposed to happen.  But it's happening.  That's why I say you don't really...  You don't want to get hung up on  trying to make an economic analysis because  nobody's any good at...  You don't get rich doing that.  If you look at...  I mentioned that Forbes list.  If you get on the list,  the number of people who have  done that by economic analysis,  I think, are just about as old as Sean there. "
48,0:23:00,0:23:11,SPEAKER 2," Okay.  Fair enough.  Income inequality, wealth inequality, you've talked about the earned income tax credit.  Is there more to it than that?  Should we adjust tax policy?  It seems to be going the other way right now. "
49,0:23:11,0:25:42,BUFFETT," Well, it is going the other way.  But I think the earned income tax credit  is the best way to put money in the pockets of people that  don't fit well into the market system,  but that are perfectly decent citizens and that  have made a good bit of the success somebody like I've had with Berkshire or something  possible.  It wouldn't have happened without the America we have.  And if you go back 200  years  and we're all working on...  80% of us are working on farms.  The person that's the best at that,  working on that farm,  whatever it may be,  is worth maybe twice the ones that's the worst.  I mean, that's the difference between super talent and no talent in the farm economy,  picking cotton or whatever it may be.  Now,  if you're the best  middleweight fighter in the world,  you may get 20 or 30 million dollars.  And if you are just a good citizen,  raise nice kids,  help in the neighborhood and everything else,  but you don't have market-related skills,  you'd be good on that farm still.  And you would be earning something  comparable to most of the people around you.  But you don't have something now that as it gets more  and more specialized, and it's going to continue to get more specialized,  you want two things for that person.  You want them to have a decent life.  I mean, they live in a country with  60,000 of GDP per person.  You want them to have a decent life, and they can.  I also think you want them to have a feeling of accomplishment.  So you want them to have a job,  assuming that they're not handicapped in some way.  You want them to have a job.  But the minimum wage would be one way,  say, well, we'll make sure that they have enough money in their pocket.  But  that's got a lot of effects in disturbing the market system.  They just need more cash.  They don't need a higher wage,  they need more cash in their pocket.  And the government at  a relatively low cost  can provide a decent living for anybody that's working 40 hours  a week and has a couple of children.  And  we've gone in that direction,  and it's sort of bipartisan.  I mean, I find both Republicans and Democrats for it.  I think it would be better not to  have one annual payment,  you know, that they get it monthly.  And I think there's various  things you could do.  But you want it.  You want them to feel part of the system,  and you want to get them,  have them get as  more and more of these golden eggs are laid,  you want them to get  a little more of their share. "
50,0:25:42,0:25:54,SPEAKER 2," I mean, if we don't do that and the Democrats win,  it's possible we get,  you know,  big taxes on wealthy people,  free college for all.  And those are bigger plans. "
51,0:25:54,0:26:47,BUFFETT," You want more money in the pockets of everybody that's willing to work  or is unable to work.  And we can do it.  A rich family would do that.  You know,  if I had six or seven kids and I  had some business I wanted to pass on,  you'd pick the most able person to run it,  because that's the market system to do that.  But you'd make sure that all seven of the family participated.  You'd give more to the one that didn't.  You might give more to the one that  kept producing the golden eggs.  You would.  But  you wouldn't just say to the one at the lowest end,  who might be the best kid of all in most respects, you know,  he's the one that shares with everybody  and does all kinds of things.  You wouldn't say to that  emperor that, you know, too bad, but that's just the way the market system works, you know.  Go have your spouse get a  job and look for housing someplace. "
52,0:26:48,0:26:57,SPEAKER 2," Right.  Why don't we do an update about the health care initiative,  which now the company has a name.  Yeah.  Haven.  Was that your idea?  No. "
53,0:26:58,0:28:55,BUFFETT," No.  Sometimes you...  No, I didn't worry about a name.  We could have gone on  as a no-name operation for 10 years as far as I'm concerned.  No,  that is...  We've got a wonderful partnership in the sense  that it's large and has  reasonable market muscle with more than a million employees  among the three of us.  We've got three CEOs that can make things get done in organizations that are so big that normally they wouldn't get very bureaucratic.  I mean,  if you try to do this with many big companies,  you'd have  legal weighing in and public relations weighing in.  We don't have any of that stuff.  They may have them in certain areas,  but I don't have to...  But Jamie isn't going to worry about doing that sort of thing.  And neither is Jeff.  So we've got a unity of commitment and an ability to execute on the commitment.  The only problem is you've got a $3.4 trillion industry,  which is as much as the federal government raises every year.  That basically feels pretty good about the system.  As we went around talking to people to find a leader for the group,  for example, everybody says  the system...  It turns out very good medicine,  but you can't go from 5% of GDP to 18 without really making you less competitive,  among other things in the world.  So everybody thought the system needed some adjustment,  just not their part of the system.  And that's very human.  I'd do the same thing,  I'm sure, if I was in the same place.  So there's an enormous resistance to change,  while a similar acknowledgement that change  will be needed.  And of course,  if the private sector doesn't supply that  over a period of time,  people will say, then  we give up, we've got to turn this over to government,  which will probably be even worse. "
54,0:28:56,0:29:00,SPEAKER 2," How often do you talk to Jamie and Jeff about it?  I know Todd Combs,  I think, is your point person. "
55,0:29:00,0:29:08,BUFFETT," Todd really does all the work at our...  If this works, give Todd 100% of the credit  from the Berkshire standpoint. "
56,0:29:08,0:29:12,SPEAKER 2, Does Haven have to buy companies to gain expertise?  What do you...
57,0:29:12,0:29:14,BUFFETT," No,  I don't think... "
58,0:29:14,0:29:15,SPEAKER 2," What is the plan?   The plan is to support  a very, very, very good thinker on this subject who is a practicing  physician and who commands the respect  of the medical community to,  in effect,  figure out some way so that we can  deliver even better care and have  people feel better about their  care too.  I mean, they have to perceive that they're receiving better care over time and  stop the march upward of cost relative to the country's output.  We've got this  incredible economic machine,  but we shouldn't  be spending 18%  when other countries are doing something  pretty comparable in terms of  doctors per capita, hospital beds per capita.  The very top stuff in medicine, I think, is  very much concentrated in this country, and that's great.  I want us to be the top leader,  but I just don't...  I think we're paying a price.  If we're paying seven extra points  of GDP,  that's 1.4 trillion a year.  Is the administration focusing...  By focusing on drug prices, is that  sort of a rabbit hole?  Is that missing the bigger picture?  Well, I don't... "
59,0:30:37,0:31:17,BUFFETT," I mean, they're trying.  Congress generally...  I mean, you talk to the average congressman.  They regard it as a problem,  and they see specific instances  of drug prices or something like that,  but it's a big problem to change.  I mean, the trouble is it intersects  in so many ways,  and that's why we've got Kewande heading it,  and we've got three bigger  size organizations backing him.  We're not trying to do it to make money.  I mean, that is not a goal that we end up with some business that  we make money off of. "
60,0:31:17,0:31:19,SPEAKER 2," Will he be talking to health insurers, for instance? "
61,0:31:20,0:31:39,BUFFETT," Well, he'll be talking to everybody,  but it is...  His game plan is not something we're  going to try and lay out because it's in his head to some degree.  I mean, obviously, we selected him by hearing and reading and so on what he's done,  but he'll learn as we go.  We will conduct certain experiments, or he will,  and try out a community where one of us has a lot of employees maybe,  and there's various ways to experiment. "
62,0:31:53,0:32:00,SPEAKER 2," Shifting gears,  where do you find things like that Abe Lincoln tail and leg quotes?  I mean, do you read Bartlett's book of quotations? "
63,0:32:00,0:32:07,BUFFETT," No, I don't read Bartlett's...  Probably 50 years ago,  I looked at a few Bartlett's quotations,  but I read a lot. "
64,0:32:07,0:32:10,SPEAKER 2, You just remember these things and apply them?
65,0:32:10,0:32:22,BUFFETT," Well, if you're 88 years old,  you ought to remember something.  You don't remember what  happened yesterday, but you remember the old stuff.  You've  got a lot of interesting quotations in your head. "
66,0:32:23,0:32:31,SPEAKER 2," You do, not like you do.  That's great.  Okay.  So one company you invested in was GE,  and you did well with that investment.  Yeah. "
67,0:32:32,0:33:00,BUFFETT," I was too early,  actually.  If you look back,  I was very active in the last half of  September and early October,  and then I wrote that article in later October.  I knew it was  going to get bad.  I wrote the article it was going to get bad,  but I didn't think the stock market  would react as much as it did between then and March.  So I had more or less used  up our powder well before the bottom was hit. "
68,0:33:01,0:33:13,SPEAKER 2," That's interesting.  How have you avoided not getting back into GE more recently?  I mean, I'm sure that they've reached out to you.  Everyone says, oh, why doesn't Warren Buffett  invest in GE and save it and take it to the promised land?  It's this great American company. "
69,0:33:14,0:33:17,BUFFETT," Well, actually, I think Larry actually is doing a good job. "
70,0:33:18,0:33:18,SPEAKER 2, Larry Kolb.
71,0:33:18,0:33:50,BUFFETT," Danaher.  Yeah, Larry Kolb at Danaher is  a good sale, and I think his priorities are straight,  and I think he's a very able guy,  and he's on the right track.  I'm a fan of GE's in the sense that  we're a big buyer from them.  We're a big seller to them.  I've known the managers.  Jack Welch is a very good friend of mine.  We don't agree on politics 100%,  but we have a lot  of fun together, and I love the guy.  So I've got a great desire for GE to do well.  It just hasn't looked that attractive to me. "
72,0:33:51,0:34:00,SPEAKER 2," Right.  You talked about the groves of trees  in the letters, shareholder.  One was the third grove,  which was sort of the in-between stakes. "
73,0:34:01,0:34:02,BUFFETT," Yeah, the equity interests. "
74,0:34:02,0:34:09,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Is it the case that those are sort of  not the healthiest grove of trees?  No.  And why would that be?
75,0:34:09,0:34:32,BUFFETT," No, those are the pilot flying Jaysbury.  No, they're companies that under GAAP accounting,  we have to record under an equity method.  We own more than 20%,  but we don't control them.  And so it's treated under GAAP accounting as a special category,  and it didn't fit well  in the other groves,  so I had to make it a separate grove by itself.  It's not that significant a grove. "
76,0:34:33,0:34:37,SPEAKER 2, You say that the sum of Berkshire has a greater valuation than the parts.
77,0:34:37,0:34:38,BUFFETT, That is true.
78,0:34:38,0:34:40,SPEAKER 2, Did you ever try to calculate that?  How much is that?
79,0:34:40,0:35:20,BUFFETT," Well, it depends on circumstances.  I mean, there's sometimes when the float from insurance  can be very valuable.  There's sometimes when the ability to use production tax credits,  we'll say, in the utility business,  but have them on our,  as part of our consolidated return helps.  But  that varies a lot.  But it is a plus.  And we can move capital.  Well, take a business like Seed's Candy,  which we bought 40-odd years ago.  It's a wonderful little business.  It throws off capital.  We've tried 50 different ways to expand geographically,  do all kinds of things.  It doesn't work.  And we'll try it again,  and it won't work. "
80,0:35:20,0:35:20,SPEAKER 2," But  we can move that capital to help buy BNSF Railroad or do all kinds of other things.  So we've got a seamless and tax-efficient way of moving capital where it's needed.  And we've got some companies that really chew up capital,  and we've got others that kick it off.  And we can move it from one part.  If you try to do that with your investments,  you incur some taxes as you go along doing it.  And it's less efficient than what we've got.  You talked a lot about the tax cuts and the benefits to Berkshire.  You didn't really get into the costs of the tax cut,  which surprised me a little bit.  What are the, are there costs?  I mean, is it just free money?  Well,  it makes a difference.  The tax cut we get,  for example, our utilities, as I mentioned in the report,  that goes to the customers.  That's just the nature of utility regulation.  But net,  we were a significant beneficiary from the tax cut.  I mean,  basically,  let's just say we had one class of stock.  We've got two.  But we have stock.  You and I own a business  together,  and we think we own all the stock.  But the truth is,  before the tax cut,  the government had a 35%  share of the stock  on income.  Now, it didn't have a share of the assets,  but it had a share of the income.  And if it wanted to change it to 40,  it could have changed it.  But fortunately, it changed it to 21.  And if we had a private business,  if we had a McDonald's franchise together,  an auto dealership together,  the third shareholder, that invisible shareholder, the governor,  just  handed us back a bunch of the shares of stock.  And our shareholders benefited,  and a lot of other shareholders benefited.  Right, you talked about Ajit Jain and Greg Abel  saying that Berkshire blood flows through their veins.  Have they made a difference since they become vice chairs?  And then, are they like Warren and Charlie? "
81,0:37:22,0:38:12,BUFFETT," No, they don't have the interaction.  They each run a separate  business.  Ajit does not think about the other businesses.  He thinks about the insurance business.  And Greg does not think about the insurance business at all.  And I think about the money and the capital and so on.  But they're running two very big businesses.  I mean, Ajit's business has,  you get all told,  at least a couple hundred billion of assets.  And Greg's business  has 150 billion of revenues.  I mean, these are,  they both would fit up there toward the top 10 or so in the country in  terms of value.  So maybe the top 15.  But they're very big businesses. "
82,0:38:13,0:38:15,SPEAKER 2," But they're not exactly like you two guys.  It's not.  Oh, no, no.   Charlie and I have a partnership thinking about the whole place,  and we've done it forever.  And we still do.  And Todd and Ted?  I didn't see them mentioned."
83,0:38:24,0:39:16,BUFFETT," Well, they have $13 billion each, including pension funds,  our pension funds,  that  they run.  And so of the $173 billion we had at year end in  equities,  they had,  well, we had $173, but we had another $8 billion in pension funds.  So of the $180 or so,  they had $26 between them that they're managing.  And they got total discretion on that.  They don't ask me.  At the month end,  I look and see what they did.  They don't do much.  They don't do a lot of trading or anything.  But I look to see what changes they made.  And Todd, for example, I mean,  he made a couple of  small investments in  private placement type operations.  And I know what the business is doing,  but I can't tell you their names. "
84,0:39:16,0:39:16,SPEAKER 2," You know,  that's his baby.  Was one of those,  you made this investment in Oracle,  and then you sold it.  Was that something they did? "
85,0:39:24,0:39:26,BUFFETT," No, that was not something they did.  That was something I did. "
86,0:39:26,0:39:29,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and you said you didn't understand it.  That's why you sold it.  But then why'd you get it in the first place? "
87,0:39:30,0:39:41,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, that's a good question,  to which I do not have a good answer.  I know.  I see development.  I know enough about the cloud to know I don't  know enough about the cloud. "
88,0:39:42,0:39:52,SPEAKER 2," Right.  OK.  So Barclays put out a note.  They said they were lowering the estimates for Berkshire,  for the EPS.  Do you read that stuff? "
89,0:39:53,0:40:48,BUFFETT," No.  Well, I mean, I may read it accidentally,  but I don't seek it out to read.  I'll put it that way.  But it just doesn't make any difference  at all.  I mean, if I spent time reading that,  I wouldn't have a time to read 10Ks.  And  we're not going to do anything different.  I don't know what we're going to earn.  As I put in the annual report,  and I really think this is unique.  I mean, we do not  prepare financial statements monthly for Berkshire.  And  there's just no other company would do it.  There's no sense doing it.  I know where the money is.  I know how the companies are doing generally.  But what difference does it make?  Because I'm not going to try and hit any number for the quarter by,  you know, having a sale on insurance or doing something even worse.  So it,  and Charlie, I mean, he knows where we stand.  And we know what businesses are doing well,  which aren't.  And we certainly know where the money is. "
90,0:40:48,0:41:01,SPEAKER 2," Another one, UBS survey of Berkshire investors says the five most important things to them are succession,  investment performance, M&A opportunity, share repurchase,  insurance margins.  Do you read that? "
91,0:41:02,0:41:06,BUFFETT," No, but I don't disagree.  I mean, I'm glad that somebody understands this. "
92,0:41:07,0:41:08,SPEAKER 2, Your own investors.  Yeah.
93,0:41:09,0:43:23,BUFFETT," Well, that's important.  You know, 54.  Well, if you go back to when I started my partnership in 1956 that  Berkshire came out of,  there were seven people sitting there at a table having dinner,  relatives primarily.  And I said, here's the partnership agreement.  It's done under Nebraska law.  It's four or five pages.  You don't need to read it.  But I said, here's a little half page,  what I call the ground rules.  And I want you to read these.  And if you feel okay about that,  about the interaction, what the expectations are and all of that sort of thing,  then we'll join forces.  And if you don't,  it's fine.  Other people have, you know, but we don't, we shouldn't be partners.  I mean,  you know, if I'm going to have a partnership with somebody,  I want it to be compatible.  It is, you know, and when you have a  public company, you can't control it.  I can't control who comes in.  I can't control some guy that comes in and thinks we were going to pay big dividends  or split the stock or something like that.  So by my actions and my communications and everything,  I want to attract the people that  from the public market that I want,  and I want to keep the others away.  Costco was built,  Sol Price, who started the Price Club and that thing.  He sat down and figured out the customer he didn't want.  And he set up a system that would keep away the customer he didn't want.  Who did he not want?  He didn't want somebody buying a quart of milk with somebody behind him with a basket of $200 worth of goods waiting for that.  So he put in a membership fee,  and by putting in a membership fee,  he killed all the drop-in business,  the business that belonged to the 7-Eleven.  We want Berkshire to keep out people who have expectations about us that are different than ours.  I mean,  good for them, and I hope they find somebody they fit.  But if you're going to run a church,  you want your seats to be filled by people that are  generally want to listen to your form of religion.  And you don't want it to change every week and say,  gee, I need a new group,  and I'll go out and talk to a bunch of investors and get them to come to my church this Sunday.  Because there's only so many seats in the church.  There's a million six hundred and forty-five thousand or so  A-equivalent shares, and those are the seats.  And I want them occupied by people that are on the same page I am. "
94,0:43:23,0:43:34,SPEAKER 2," The church of Berkshire.  Seems like you've got a big weighting in financials,  and of course you finally invested in Jamie Dimon's company.  Why banks right now? "
95,0:43:35,0:43:59,BUFFETT," They're businesses I understand,  and I like the price at which they're selling relative  to their future prospects.  I think ten years from now that they'll be worth more money,  and I feel there's a very high probability I'm right.  And I don't think they'll turn out to be the best investments at all.  You know, the whole panoply of things you could do,  but I'm pretty sure that they won't disappoint me. "
96,0:44:00,0:44:03,SPEAKER 2, Is climate change changing your insurance businesses?
97,0:44:03,0:44:05,BUFFETT," No, it doesn't change the insurance business. "
98,0:44:05,0:44:08,SPEAKER 2, Does it change  modeling or something in the business?
99,0:44:08,0:45:42,BUFFETT," No, it would change our insurance business if we were writing 20-year policies.  I mean, if there was something that changed life mortality adversely to the interests  of a life insurance company,  you're stuck with a policy for 20 years if you write the  life insurance policy, and you'll keep paying your premiums if it's adverse to me.  That's what's happened in long-term care insurance,  for example.  But when you write a policy for  one year at a time,  you see what the developments are.  And if,  you know,  cars, for example,  are much safer to drive than they used to be.  There used to be 15 deaths per 100 million miles driven.  Now there's a little over one.  On the other hand,  they've become much more expensive to fix.  I mean, that little side view mirror,  which used to cost 10 bucks,  you know, now a thousand bucks or something like that.  So you have things that are changing in terms of,  if you're writing collision insurance,  you've got to allow for the fact that the windshield,  the bumper, all kinds of things,  or the side view mirror and all that are way more expensive.  But if you're writing liability,  you know that people aren't going to die as often.  So climate change is like, climate's been changing.  But the  truth is that you now can buy really big catastrophe limits  cheaper than you could buy them in 2005 or thereabouts,  allowing for changes in the dollar and concentration of population. "
100,0:45:42,0:45:42,SPEAKER 2," So,  so far, rates have come down.  That's the reason we've gotten out of  the cat business to a great degree.  We were a very big writer of cat business  10 or 12 years ago.  We aren't out of the cat business because of climate change.  We're out because the prices aren't right.  And the world will change.  And that's got very serious consequences.  But it won't change that much from year to year.  That,  you know, we've done very well during a period of  some climate change.  You've talked about technology advancing faster than our ability to understand it.  And I'm wondering if  social media and Facebook and Google and  Russian trolls coming in,  is that maybe an example of that?  Are you still worried about that problem?   Well, I think cyber poses real risks to humanity.  Forgetting about the problem of even misinformation.  I'm just thinking of,  you know, we have railroads running over 22 ,000 miles of track and some of them are carrying ammonia and some of them are carrying,  you know, chlorine and things.  We have to carry them.  We have no choice about that.  We're required by law to carry them.  And, you know, I would rather do that in a non-cyber world than a cyber world.  There are all kinds of things.  The problem about something like cyber is that it's moving and it's just unpredictable  whether you'll get some crazy guy like,  stuck the anthrax in the,  you know, what they can do becomes magnified.  I mean, when you saw what,  you know, 19 guys did, you know,  on 9-11.  I mean,  tools in the hands or potentially in the hands  of either crazy individuals,  crazy groups, or even a few crazy governments, you know, are really something.  And we don't necessarily know what  all the tools they have are.  And that is moving all the time.  I mean, you know,  again, Einstein said, he said, I know not with what  weapons World War III will be fought,  but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.  You know, I mean, it's  a dangerous world.  I don't know if you've been following this,  Warren, but what do you think of Elon Musk's  behavior as a CEO? "
101,0:48:08,0:48:10,BUFFETT," Well, I think it has room for improvement. "
102,0:48:11,0:48:12,SPEAKER 2," Now,  he,  he, and he would say the same thing.  I mean, it's just some people have  a talent for interesting quotes and others,  others have a little bit more of a blocker up there that says this can get me in a problem.  And,  but he's,  he's a remarkable guy,  but I don't see,  I just don't see the necessity  to communicate.  You know, I've never,  I think I've got seven tweets because a friend of  mine signed me up for it and she's called me about a hundred times,  say, can I tweet this or that?  And I said yes to her seven times,  I guess, or something like that.  I've never actually written one myself.  I don't even know how to do it.  Have you talked to Elon ever? "
103,0:49:01,0:49:13,BUFFETT," He joined the giving pledge.  So once or twice,  but that's a lot of years ago,  you know, seven or eight years ago.  I'm not,  he hasn't come to our annual gatherings,  so I haven't seen  him for seven or eight years. "
104,0:49:14,0:49:28,SPEAKER 2," So let's talk about this,  this trade war that's been going on a little bit with China.  And I guess I'd like to ask you,  do you think that Donald Trump was right in calling out  the Chinese government and basically putting them on notice? "
105,0:49:28,0:50:04,BUFFETT," I won't have any comment on,  on, on, on that.  In  terms of political activity,  I don't put my citizenship in a blind,  blind trust.  So when the election comes around,  I'll, I'll do something.  On the other hand,  people will interpret things I say about any,  any president,  you know, as to some extent coming from Berkshire  and they, and they don't come from Berkshire.  I'm just an individual.  So I,  I, I, you know, I think I'm glad to talk about China,  but I can't, I can't talk to you about that part of it. "
106,0:50:04,0:50:10,SPEAKER 2," Fair enough.  I mean, do you think there was  room for improvement then in terms of the trade relationship between China and the United   States?  Well, I think that  China and the United States  absolutely are destined to be the superpowers, you know,  beyond my great-grandchildren lives.  And we'll always  have, be competitors and we'll be competitors in business,  we'll be competitors in ideas,  all kinds of ways.  And  there's no other way it would be.  And we just have to make sure that that  competition doesn't  get,  get us to a point where we don't realize that the best world is one in which both the United States and China prosper.  I mean, we do not want to have an island of prosperity in the rest of the world,  envious of us  in a, in a nuclear age.  And, and China doesn't,  Russia doesn't, I mean, we all recognize the dangers of letting  competition get out of control and, and, and become,  you can, you can be competitors without being enemies.  And, and that's,  that's what  all powerful nations have to realize over  time.  I mean, it's different than 200 years ago when you could have  some dominant country and then they may have done some things that you didn't like,  but it didn't threaten the existence of the world.  You really threaten the existence of the world as we know it.  If  important countries do not constantly recognize that they can compete,  they can fight over  certain things, but they can't regard it as  essentially the equivalent of war.  Here's a question from Kevin Chen,  who is a Berkshire shareholder and an NYU professor.  And he says, and this is sort of along the lines of what you were just saying,  Warren, but do you think that U.S.  and China will be able to resolve their differences or are conflicts unavoidable? "
107,0:52:04,0:52:48,BUFFETT," Well, I don't think conflicts are unavoidable, but I think,  I think  it has to be  active thinking on the part of  every hugely powerful country.  And Russia is hugely powerful.  I mean, 90% of the nuclear arms in the world are between U.S.  and Russia.  So they, they have to recognize that  the best world for them is one where they don't try and grab all the apples basically.  And we have to recognize that.  And, and we can't,  in the United States,  we can't think that either our ideas run the world,  you know, or we started getting aggressive about things  and China can't think that Russia can't think that.   And,  and that's obvious.  You just have to make things,  you got to be sure things don't escalate.  You know, you have World War I,  you know, with an Archduke, you know, I mean, you get,  you get these,  you can get chance incidents and you really want to,  I asked one of the presidents one time,  you know, in terms of what he would do if awakened in the middle of the night with  somebody coming to him and saying,  absolutely,  you know, somebody else had launched,  you know,  would you launch on that?  And you've got  10 minutes to decide.  I wouldn't want to have that responsibility,  but, but you want to make sure you don't get to that point."
108,0:53:29,0:53:37,SPEAKER 2," Right, right.  Would you ever make a big acquisition in China?  And if not, aren't you missing a huge  portion of the world? "
109,0:53:37,0:53:39,BUFFETT," Yeah, the answer is we would.  Yeah, we would. "
110,0:53:39,0:53:40,SPEAKER 2, Have you looked?
111,0:53:41,0:53:44,BUFFETT," We've been made aware of some things, yeah. "
112,0:53:45,0:53:52,SPEAKER 2," Are you concerned on the flip side of the coin?  Are you concerned that the rule of law is different,  that the accounting might be opaque? "
113,0:53:53,0:54:57,BUFFETT," Well,  I'd want to be sure I understood the accounting,  obviously, some businesses that'd be easier to do than others, but,  but  I know the laws,  the customs,  the accounting,  the people better in the United States than any place else.  So there's some small hurdle in,  in many countries to get over,  which I can get over.  I mean, but I, but I just don't,  it's just not as easy as looking at something where I already know the answer,  you know, from previous transactions or something of the sort.  So,  so it, it's easier to make a big acquisition in the United States.  I have to do more work  if I'm looking beyond the borders,  but I love the idea of doing it.  When we made the acquisition in Israel a dozen years ago,  you know, I didn't know what the tax  rates were there.  I didn't, I didn't know what corporate law,  you know, I was,  I, I suspected that it would all be answered satisfactorily,  which it was, but  I didn't just automatically know it. "
114,0:54:58,0:55:03,SPEAKER 2," It seems like you're more open about doing a deal in China than in previous conversations.   I don't think so.  No, I,  no,  I, I'm open.  Yeah. "
115,0:55:11,0:55:18,BUFFETT," We made,  you know, we made  two decent sized stock acquisitions there and they worked out fine. "
116,0:55:18,0:55:18,SPEAKER 2, Those are?
117,0:55:19,0:55:20,BUFFETT," Well, Petro China and BYD. "
118,0:55:20,0:55:21,SPEAKER 2," BYD, yes. "
119,0:55:21,0:55:24,BUFFETT," Yeah, BYD was Charlie's, but Charlie's very well-versed on China. "
120,0:55:25,0:55:35,SPEAKER 2," Right.  Yeah.  The, the trade, the U.S.  trade deficit has been widening and of course a lot of that  has to do with our trade with  China.  Is that something that worries you? "
121,0:55:36,0:56:53,BUFFETT," Well, I wrote an article about it for Fortune and the trade situation many years ago when,  when our deficit got to be  large in relation to GDP.  I don't think it's,  I don't think it's essential to have a trade balance,  but I, I think that if a trade deficit gets large  and, and it looks like you have no way out from it,  that that can be a real problem over time.  I mean, you're, you know, you're, you're shipping little pieces of paper to the rest of the world and they're shipping you goods.  I mean, people are working, making underwear or shoes someplace and they get little pieces of paper from us.  And it gets very tempting if you've done that enough to make sure that those little pieces of paper aren't worth very much over time when they want to cash them for something.  So you don't want to have,  we don't have any problem running trade deficits,  but, but if we ran really large ones and we sort of worked ourselves into a box where they were,  we didn't really have a solution to get the numbers down,  it could be a problem.  And I wrote about it one time,  but it's, it's kind of a nice thing actually.  Just, I mean, wouldn't you like to have something where you just send out little pieces of paper and somebody keep supplying you with their food or your,  you know, whatever. "
122,0:56:53,0:56:54,SPEAKER 2, I'm living it.
123,0:56:54,0:56:55,BUFFETT, You're all right.   Exactly.  And we call them credit cards in the United States.
124,0:56:57,0:57:15,SPEAKER 2," Exactly.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  And last question,  China's facing its slowest growth in nearly three decades.  The leadership there lower the targets,  I think to around 6.5%, 6%.  Are you concerned about this slowing growth and the impact on global markets?  Well,  I don't worry about in terms of global markets.  I mean, China's going to grow a lot over time.  I mean, they,  when you think of what's happened,  oh, this is 1949 or where, you know, but  there's been nothing really like it.  I mean, you had 20% of the  world's population at that time, perhaps,  really hadn't remotely achieved their potential.  I mean, the intellectual capacity, they had  decent soil, all kinds of things.  I mean, and, and, and,  and what's happened there almost is beyond belief and, and  that game's not over, but we've had  incredible developments in the United States.  I mean, you know,  real GDP per capita is six times  what it was the day I was born in the United States,  six times.  And we thought we were  a pretty developed country then and everything.  No, my parents wouldn't have believed it.  I mean, they, they would have thought,  you know, that this  kid has really got it made,  you know, I was born in the United States and it was true.  I mean, we had this tailwind  and, and China's had a hurricane behind it,  you know, in the, in recent decades.  In a good way. "
125,0:58:28,0:58:29,BUFFETT, Absolutely.
126,0:58:29,0:58:32,SPEAKER 2, Because you were comparing it to the tailwind of the hurricane at your back.
127,0:58:32,0:59:16,BUFFETT," Yeah, at their back.  And, and, and they've,  they have found a way of life that is dramatically different  than existed for the billion,  there was a billion then,  maybe, maybe a billion, two or three, whatever it is now.  And, and  they have changed  a  country really of size  that's, I don't think there's ever been anything like it.  We've done it too,  but it took, it took, it took so much longer.  I mean, it was more stretched out.  It was a remarkable period, but,  but  you know, when you go to,  I first went there in 1995 and then they regarded  it as a miracle.  And then I went back 10 years later,  it was a whole different country beyond that. "
128,0:59:17,0:59:23,SPEAKER 2," Warren Buffett, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Andy Serwer.  You've been watching Influencers.  We'll see you next time. "
129,0:00:00,0:00:34,SPEAKER 1," We are here in Omaha,  Nebraska this morning with Warren Buffett,  the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.  He's just released his 55th annual shareholder letter to the shareholders over this weekend.  And this is actually the 13th year that we are now in Omaha talking to him after that letter.  This is a show that we call Ask Warren so that people can write in their own questions to Mr.  Buffett after they've read that shareholder's letter.  But obviously this morning,  given the news, there are a lot of other questions that people have concerning the stock market.  Let's jump right into it with Mr.  Buffett, who is here with us right now.  And Warren, thank you for being here today.  It's good to see you. "
130,0:00:34,0:00:35,BUFFETT, Thanks for having me.
131,0:00:35,0:00:54,SPEAKER 1," I want to talk about the letter.  Obviously, one of the things that you touch on in the letter is when people should be buying stocks.  We're going to dig into a lot of it.  But when you're looking at the futures down about 818 points this morning,  I think probably the first thing viewers want to hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus,  if this is a reason to panic and if you are worried about this.  Well,  I don't know I have any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus.  The very first day I bought stocks was March 12th, 1941,  40, 40, 42.  And the stocks were down about 2 percent that day,  as it turned out.  Unfortunately, I bought in the morning.  So when I came home in the evening and my dad told me the execution price,  it was down 2 percent. And I said, I'm not worried about that."
132,0:01:17,0:01:30,BUFFETT," If you're buying a business,  and that's what stocks are, businesses,  in fact, people will be better off if they  say I bought a business today,  not a stock today,  because that gives you a different perspective on it.   Then  presumably you're going to buy a farm,  if you buy an apartment house, if you buy a business,  you're going to own it for 10 or 20 or 30 years.  And the real question is,  has the 10-year or 20-year  outlook for American businesses changed in the  last 24 hours or 48 hours?  And we're going to  you'll notice many of the businesses we own, partially own,  American Express, we've owned it for 20 years,  Coca-Cola, we've owned it for 40 years.  Those are businesses.  And you don't buy or sell your business based on on on today's  headlines.  And if it gives you a chance to buy something that you like and you can buy it  even cheaper, then it's your good luck, basically.  Although there are a lot of people who look at the market and they say,  look, I want to buy,  but I don't want to buy when the market's sitting at new highs,  when it's been hitting new records every day.  Maybe it's off 800 points this morning,  but maybe there's more of a decline to come because the effect of the coronavirus is going to be an impact on the global economy.  IMF said that over the weekend.  You are going to see weakness as not only China,  but other countries try and address this.  You're right.  It may not change things over the five or 10 year span of things.  But if I think that I can buy something for potentially 10 percent cheaper,  maybe more than that,  if I wait a week or a month,  maybe that's what I'm sitting around.  Well, if you think that,  then you've got to you're going to get fabulously rich if you're right.  All you have to do is just keep buying at 10 day intervals and keep taking your 10 day prediction.  If I knew what the market was going to do,  obviously."
133,0:02:59,0:03:11,SPEAKER 1," But you don't I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.  I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.  Everybody, when they buy a stock,  if you're going to buy,  say, General Motors,  it has a billion,  four hundred million shares out.  You should be able to take a yellow pad like you have there.  And on one page, say, let's say it's selling for 30.  It isn't selling that low,  but that'd be 42 billion.  You should say I am buying the General Motors company for 42 billion dollars because.  And you should get it on a piece of paper.  And then if you want to have a shepherd piece of paper,  since I think I know what the stock market is going to do,  so I know whether it will be higher or lower.  But you don't  you don't have that.  But if I worry that the economy is going to slow down,  not just for the quarter,  but for the year,  that would impact how many cars I think they may be able to sell or even produce. "
134,0:03:50,0:05:20,BUFFETT," I'll guarantee cars are going to slow down someday.  They in 1932, General Motors  had 19000 dealers.  That's more than all the auto dealers in the United States today.  There are only one hundred and twenty five million people,  but they had 19000 dealers.  They produced  or sold.  And there was one month,  I think, when they sold less than a tenth of a car,  right at a tenth of a car per dealer.  That was a terrific time to buy General Motors.  And forget about the market.  If you can predict the market,  you don't read balance sheets.  You don't need to read anything.  You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper.  That is for sure.  And you really can't.  You certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.  But you're buying businesses.  And if you plan to buy a local service station yesterday and it was closing day,  I don't think you'd tear your hair out or anything like that.  You'd have already looked at where it was located and the contract that they had with the suppliers and made a decision on competition.  People,  because they can make decisions every second in stocks,  whereas they can't with farms,  they think an investment in stocks is different than an investment in a business or an investment in a farm or investment in an apartment house.  But it isn't.  If you get your money's worth in terms of future earning power over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years,  you're going to have made a good investment.  And you can't pick them from day to day.  If you can do that, you can. "
135,0:05:21,0:05:21,SPEAKER 1," Well,  I haven't met anybody yet that  knows how to do it.  You made a point of that in the letter this year where you highlighted a book that was written by Edgar Lawrence Smith back in 1924.  And you said until he came along,  nobody really realized the compound interest effect of buying stocks,  not just buying businesses,  but buying stocks themselves. "
136,0:05:43,0:05:52,BUFFETT," Edgar Lawrence Smith changed the world with that book.  And the people have forgotten all about it now,  although in the 1920s it became more and more gospel as the boom went on. "
137,0:05:52,0:05:52,SPEAKER 1," But  Edgar Lawrence Smith  set out to write a book on bonds versus stocks.  And he said he went in with the idea that bonds would be a better investment in times of deflation and stocks would be a better investment in times of inflation.  And the first line of his book was to say that he'd been wrong,  but he had enough sense to look at his evidence.  I think Darwin said,  if you found evidence that was contrary to what you already believed,  write it down in 30 minutes or your mind will just block it out.  People have a great resistance to new evidence.  And he said, if a stock yields 4%,  the bond yields 4%,  which was what he was talking about then,  the stock was going to outperform the bonds because there were retained earnings that were building beyond that yield. And that has been true for a long,  long time, but nobody paid any attention to it.  We don't get rich on our dividends that we receive,  although we're happy to receive them.  We get rich on  the fact that the retained earnings are used to build new earning power,  repurchase  shares, which increases your ownership in the company.  And Berkshire has retained earnings ever since we started.  That's the only reason Berkshire is worth a lot more,  is we retain earnings.  That led Keynes to actually say that this was an important book.  People paid attention to it,  but you're right.  It added to the frenzy that built up to 1929. "
138,0:07:18,0:08:25,BUFFETT," Well, that is true because  you can get,  my old boss, Ben Graham, told me very early on,  you get more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea,  because the good idea works.  I mean, it's a good idea to buy a home,  for example, and then  people go crazy.  The good idea works and it works and it works.  Stocks work out better than bonds most of the time.  And after a while,  people forget that there were some other limiting conditions.  With Edgar Lawrence Smith's book,  it was that when bonds yield the same as stocks,  which was the case then,  that stocks are going to outperform because they have this retained  earnings.  So stocks started going up in the 20s and all of a sudden they were selling at five  or six times the prices as when he bought the book.  And the original correct  perception on his part  had experienced changing conditions.  But people just looked.  They got their confirmation through the stock prices.  And that's what happens in bull markets.  People start out thinking stocks are cheap and then they start thinking stocks have gone up.  And a stock can be a good buy or a bad buy.  A bond can be a good buy or bad buy.  It depends on price. "
139,0:08:26,0:08:44,SPEAKER 1," But that leads us to today.  I mean, if his premise was that stocks are always going to be a better investment than bonds,  that's kind of what you hear today,  which we've been hearing for a while is,  Tina, there is no alternative,  right?  You have to buy stocks because bond yields are so low,  because interest rates are so low.  Well,  if you look at the present situation,  we've talked about this before,  that you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.  That doesn't have to be the case.  I mean, but it's usually been the case in America,  very usually in the case.  And if you buy a 30 year bond today with a yield 2 percent,  you're paying 50 times earnings for an investment where the earnings can't go up for 30 years.  Now, if somebody said, I want to sell you a stock that's at 50 times earnings,  the earnings can't go up for 30 years,  you'd say that doesn't sound very good.  But stocks are way better than 30 year bonds.  I mean, that's clear.  And that's one of the  alternatives people have.  People really have  three basic alternatives, short term cash, which is an option of doing something later on,  long term bonds or long term stocks.  And stocks are cheaper than bonds.  Charlie said recently, Charlie Munger, the vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway,  had his Daily Journal meeting just a couple of weeks ago.  And at that meeting,  he said that there's  a lot of wretched excess out there and that there's a lot of trouble coming as a result.  Do you agree with that? "
140,0:09:51,0:10:10,BUFFETT," There's always trouble coming.  Yeah, there was trouble coming in 1942 when I bought that first stock,  all kinds of trouble.  Philippines were going to fall pretty soon.  There's all kinds of trouble in 1949.  There was trouble,  certainly trouble in 2008  when I wrote an article for The New York Times.  I said trouble is coming.  But I said buy stocks. "
141,0:10:11,0:10:15,SPEAKER 1," Would you repeat that this time?  If trouble's coming, would you still say buy stocks right now? "
142,0:10:15,0:10:17,BUFFETT, I would say buy stocks if you get enough for your money.
143,0:10:19,0:10:20,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, we buy a few stocks, but we don't look at we're not buying the stock market.  We're saying I am buying,  let's say, American Express.  We own American Express.  There's eight hundred and fifteen million shares out and sells it.  This morning is one hundred and twenty six or something like that.  So it's selling for roughly one hundred billion dollars.  Now, the real question is whether the company is worth more or less than one hundred billion.  It isn't what the stock is going to do tomorrow or next week or next month.  You said just a few minutes ago when we asked you on Worldwide Exchange right now,  Berkshire Hathaway is a net buyer of stocks.  You are in a net buying position. "
144,0:10:55,0:11:29,BUFFETT," We've been a net buyer of stocks.  Or I've actually been a personal net buyer of stocks  ever since I was 11 every year.  There's been 15 American presidents in my lifetime,  more than a third.  I've lived under a third of them.  Well, I didn't buy stocks under Hoover.  I was only about six months old then.  But but there have been seven Republicans after that and seven Democrats.  I bought stocks under every one of them.  Now, I haven't bought stocks every day.  There have been a few times I've thought stocks were were really quite high.  And  I've even written an article once or twice,  but that's very seldom. "
145,0:11:29,0:11:36,SPEAKER 1," But you wrapped up your partnership at one point.  I wrapped up my partnership once because I thought it was too expensive.  Yeah.  OK, but this is not a time like that. "
146,0:11:38,0:11:46,BUFFETT," We own two hundred and forty billion dollars worth of stocks.  Now, we look at that as two hundred and forty billion dollars worth of businesses  that we own parts of. "
147,0:11:46,0:11:46,SPEAKER 1, But
148,0:11:47,0:11:48,BUFFETT, I love owning those businesses.
149,0:11:49,0:11:52,SPEAKER 1, You've also got more than one hundred and twenty five billion dollars in cash sitting around.
150,0:11:52,0:11:54,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, we'd like to buy more businesses. "
151,0:11:54,0:12:09,SPEAKER 1," We are here,  Warren, with you at Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters building.  This is upstairs in the room that's called the Cloud Room.  And this is a room where you often take students to kind of talk to them about questions they have when they come to visit you.  You also do some other things up here, too.  Other presentations. "
152,0:12:10,0:12:40,BUFFETT," Yeah, I had students there for dozens of years and  for many years, 40 schools would come in.  They'd come in groups of eight  at five days.  I spent a year and they come from all over the world.  We have them from Peru.  We have them from China.  We had from Israel.  And we had a good time, obviously.  I guess I've given it up now.  I but I I started teaching when I was 21 and I when I got to about 88,  I thought I'd take a rest. "
153,0:12:40,0:13:12,SPEAKER 1," Well, there are a lot of questions that are coming in from viewers that have been hitting here today.  They're waking up this morning looking at the stock market indicated down by almost 800 points for the Dow.  We're actually off our worst levels of the morning,  which is something to say when you're still looking at the Dow down by about seven hundred and eighty six points.  But people have a lot of questions about the economy.  They're wondering what's happening right now,  particularly with the coronavirus out there.  You have a lot of economic data at your fingertips because not only are the many businesses that Berkshire owns,  but the businesses you own pieces in.  What are you seeing right now around the globe? "
154,0:13:12,0:14:31,BUFFETT," Well, it affects various businesses.  I'm I would I would say that I received commentary.  I get some commentary monthly with from from almost all of the companies and a good many of them had some comment about how it was affecting them.  And however, it was affecting them at that time.  I'm sure it's accentuated,  but they've been affected by they were affected by tariffs.  They're affected by taxes.  They're affected by the most thing is they're affected by competitors in supply and demand over time.  And I don't have the faintest idea what our businesses will be doing six months from now or 12 months from now.  I do think that not only our businesses,  but American business generally,  we're doing fabulously better 30 years from now or 20 years from now.  And the the long term is very,  in my view, is very easy to predict in the general way,  but an important way.  I don't think there's any way to predict what the stock market will do 10 minutes from now,  10 days from now or 10 months from now.  So I work on what I think I'm able to do and as desirable as it might be to know what was going to happen 10 minutes from now.  That's just not something I'll ever be able to master.  So fortunately,  I can come to a pretty firm conclusion that  20 or 30 years from now,  America business and probably over the world will be far better than it is now. "
155,0:14:31,0:14:36,SPEAKER 1, What are the momentary implications that you've seen from coronavirus?  What's an example of a business?
156,0:14:36,0:14:50,BUFFETT," Well, an example, for example, we have maybe a thousand Dairy Queen  franchises in  China here and they're just treat only.  So they're the old  older type, not with food. "
157,0:15:10,0:15:10,SPEAKER 1,"But  a great number of them are closed.  But the ones that were open weren't doing any business to speak of.  And and Apple is I mean,  our much bigger holding is Apple.  We own five point six percent of Apple.  And and the company came out and said that it's affecting not only its stores,  but all kinds of things, supply chain. And"
158,0:15:11,0:15:16,BUFFETT, I find that certain of our companies have got supply chain arrangements that are being affected by this that I didn't even know had those.
159,0:15:16,0:15:17,SPEAKER 1, Like what?
160,0:15:18,0:15:44,BUFFETT," Well, I got one from Johns Manville the other day,  for example.  You wouldn't normally think of them as having a big supply chain,  but shore carpets or you name it.  I'll guarantee you that a very significant percentage of our business is one layer affected,  but they're being affected by a lot of other things, too.  And the real question is, is  where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years?  They'll have ups and downs.  Our candy business is a wonderful business,  but it loses money seven months out of the year. "
161,0:15:44,0:15:44,SPEAKER 1," But  the nice thing is Christmas comes every year.  When you look at the economy and how things were kind of chugging along,  let's say beginning of this year,  when first things things first picked up,  how would you gauge the U.S.  economy? "
162,0:15:56,0:16:44,BUFFETT," Well, it's it's strong, but a little softer than it was six months ago.  But that's over a broad range of it.  You look at car loadings,  rail car loadings, that's moving goods around.  And there again, that was affected by the tariffs,  too, because people front ended purchases,  all kinds of things.  There's always a lot of variables.  But the business is down and and but it's down from a very good level.  So I would say that looking at our 70 businesses and that actually they represent hundreds.  In addition,  they're a little softer.  On the other hand,  I was out with the  fellows from the Nebraska Furniture Mart just Saturday night and their business was up quite a bit in February.  But that's because weather was good.  So you have a lot of variables that hit. "
163,0:16:45,0:16:54,SPEAKER 1," Why do you think business was down,  let's say, the last six months?  Is that a decline in confidence or is it coming off of levels where there was unusual activity ahead of that? "
164,0:16:55,0:17:31,BUFFETT," Well, it isn't really down.  It's just leveled off and a little softer maybe now.  But well, tariffs,  the tariff situation was a big question mark for all kinds of companies and still is to some degree.  But that that was front and center for a while.  Now, coronavirus is front and center.  Something else will be front and center six months from now and a year from now and two years from now.  Real question is, is where are these businesses going to be five and ten and 20 years from now?  Some of them will do sensationally.  Some of them will disappear.  And overall, I think America will do very well.  You know,  it has since 1776. "
165,0:17:31,0:17:34,SPEAKER 1, But you still watch things like rail carloads very closely.
166,0:17:34,0:17:54,BUFFETT," I watch everything.  But I don't do it to make  specific investment decisions.  But I enjoy it.  I mean, I want to know what's going on.  But I also don't think that I can make money by predicting what's going to go on next week or next month.  I do think I can make money by predicting what's going to happen in 10 years.   All right.  Well, tell us more about what's going on,  just since you like knowing about those things.  Well,  as I say, you know,  the the.  Certain businesses depend on weather to quite an extent in retail,  for example, in given months.  But the big trends you see are going on,  I mean, in terms of the movement to online commerce and I mean,  the big stuff keeps moving.  But we've got a big investment airline  business and I just heard,  you know, even more flights are canceled and all that.  But flights are canceled for weather.  So happens in this case,  they're going to be canceled for longer because of coronavirus. "
167,0:18:34,0:18:34,SPEAKER 1," But  if you own airlines for 10 or 20 years,  you're going to have some ups and downs in current business and some of the weather related.  And they can be all kinds of things.  The real question is,  is, you know, how many passengers are they going to be carrying 10 years from now and 15 years from now?  And what will margins be?  And what will the competitive position be?  And but I still look at the figures all the time.  I'll admit that you you mentioned the airlines and you own stakes in all the major airlines,  not as much as Delta.  I think you own north of 11 percent of Delta at this point.  Well, right. "
168,0:19:10,0:19:28,BUFFETT, We are the largest position is in Delta.  Three of the four positions are mine.  One of the positions is one of the other fellows of the four positions.  But we own a very roughly close to 10 percent of of the four largest airlines.
169,0:19:28,0:19:39,SPEAKER 1," There's been a lot of speculation.  In fact, some of the questions that came in over this weekend were questions about those airlines,  wondering if you would buy any of them outright.  Have you considered buying any of those companies?   It'd be very unlikely we would do that.  I'm not saying it's impossible,  but it's complicated.  Why? "
170,0:19:47,0:20:20,BUFFETT," Well, for one thing, they're regulated and there's an interplay.  I'll just give you an example,  not that we'd be doing, but with Delta,  we own 18 percent of American Express and American Express is a bank holding company and bank holding companies have limits as to what they can do.  And we're a passive holder of a bank holding company with American Express.  But if we owned an airline that was tied up with them,  they'd have lots of arrangements.  There's there's there's a lot of complications because it's a regulated industry.  Anytime you get in a regulated industry,  you have more complications  and in transactions. "
171,0:20:21,0:20:26,SPEAKER 1," So is it fair to say you like these stocks and you would own more if it wasn't complicated?  Well,  we if to go beyond 15 percent in any company,  we would have to go in on hard Scott  Rodino.  I mean, there's a lot of rules as you increase your ownership.  Obviously,  almost anything we own,  we'd like to own more of.  Are you buying more of any of those stakes right now?  Apple, right. "
172,0:20:46,0:20:50,BUFFETT, I get pretty close mouth when it comes to what we're buying.
173,0:20:51,0:20:53,SPEAKER 1, I thought about that for a second.
174,0:20:53,0:21:18,BUFFETT," My jaws lock up.  But it's fair to say that anything that we own,  we like, you know, and  there's very few stocks  that we own.  And I look at them as part ownerships and businesses.  There's very few that are selling at some price where I would sell them a little higher. "
175,0:21:19,0:21:34,SPEAKER 1," All right.  Well, let me ask a question that came from Tony Dickinson.  He said in the fourth quarter,  Berkshire sold 55 million shares of Wells Fargo.  Should shareholders view this as a lack of confidence in the new CEO turnaround planned?  And what is Warren's future outlook for Wells Fargo? "
176,0:21:34,0:21:55,BUFFETT," Yeah, well,  I won't give him any advice specifically on Wells Fargo,  but it's absolutely true that  we've sold down our position.  Some of it was sold down to avoid being over 10 percent,  because then you do have some  filings with the Fed and so on.  But we have more than that.  Yeah, we've sold.  We've sold well more than that. "
177,0:21:55,0:21:58,SPEAKER 1," I think eight point four percent was the last.  Yeah,  that sounds right.  And we've we've sold.  We sold Wells Fargo in the fourth quarter and we sold earlier.  Can I ask why?  Only because I did get a number of questions.  I know.   Well, I can understand that.  But the we just don't we don't want to give any advice on what we're doing because I could change what I'm doing tomorrow.  So we we talk about everything except we don't give stock advice.  OK,  I'll try one more from Dickinson just because I think I got 15 or 20 different questions on this.  Berkshire owns thirty two point five eight billion of Bank of America and seventeen point three nine billion of Wells Fargo.  One position's been increasing while the other's been decreasing.  Does Warren like Bank of America twice as much as Wells Fargo?  And how should shareholders see the holdings?  Yeah, well, I think they've seen that we bought  we bought Bank of America and we sold some Wells Fargo.  All right.  Let me ask you a broader question that comes in just on interest rates and the impact that that might have as well.  Veroon Jane writes in on Facebook.  Hi, I'm a huge fan and a student of Mr.  Buffett.  Please ask him what impact does the zero interest rate environment across places like Japan and Europe have on their banks,  whether the business is still good and does the prolonged low interest rate regime in the United States hurt the prospects of American banks  like J.P.  Morgan, et cetera?  And in such circumstances,  do Indian banks, which have high return on equity,  look attractive to Mr.  Buffett? "
178,0:23:24,0:23:51,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, I can't comment on that.  But generally speaking,  with a lot of but  there are a lot  of other variables, too.  But the banks are going to make more money if there's if there  are higher rates with a with a steeper curve.  The curve makes  is more important.  In other words, the 10 year versus  short term rates  may make more difference than the absolute level. "
179,0:23:51,0:23:51,SPEAKER 1, But
180,0:23:51,0:24:14,BUFFETT," American banks have made very good money with very low interest rates around the world.  If you look in the UK or Europe or Japan,  even lower rates have made it pretty tough for banks.  The returns on equity are not as high and they have to use more leverage  to even get the same returns.  And I don't like that as well. "
181,0:24:15,0:24:24,SPEAKER 1," If you are talking about the curve that we're looking at this morning,  the five year, two year is inverted.  Two year ten is not right now,  but the 10 years below one point four  percent this morning.  And think of the 10 year at one point four percent.  That means you're paying 70 times earnings for for something that can't increase its earnings for 10 years.  Now, somebody somebody can do with a stock and said, you know, we this is a terrific  stock.  It sells at 70 times earnings.  The earnings can't go up for 10 years.  You'd say, well, explain that to me again.  Right.  But  no, the interest that we've never seen a situation like this in the world.  Literally.  I mean, you can go back and read Keynes and you can read Adam Smith and you can read,  you know, all the great ones.  And they don't talk about negative interest rate.  It never cost their might.  How much supply and demand all these marginal costs.  But brilliant economists never really anticipated that you would have negative.  And you've got 13 trillion or something like that worldwide at negative interest rates.  And we don't know what that means.  And we've got a lot of people who speculate what it means.  But 10 years from now or 15 years from now,  we'll look back and say,  well, it's obvious what we have under that.  And we'll we'll see it.  But it is not a normal situation.  And it's it's well,  interest rates are the basis of all value.  I mean, you know, that if if you knew interest rates were going to be zero for a hundred years,  you would think 1 percent was a great rate of return.  But you also would know if you bought something was yielding 1 percent or  that was what it paid and rates went to 8 percent,  you'd lose practically all your capital.  So it's an enormous factor.  And we don't know the answer.  Central banks don't know the answer.  All we know is that it it's been useful in stimulating things and particularly asset prices now for 10 years.  And what we thought was temporary in 2008  and nine in the way of monetary policy to stimulate,  we've just put our foot on the gas even further.  The whole world has.  You made a point in the letter of saying that you don't know how long these interest rates will last.  You and Charlie never try and figure these things out.  But we did have St.  Louis Fed President Jim Bullard on the program last week,  and he said that he expects to see these low interest rates for a long time to come.  That does raise a lot of questions if that happens,  about what this means for the stock market,  what that means for banks,  what that means for insurance companies,  which you touched on in the letter,  too. "
182,0:26:46,0:26:50,BUFFETT," It's bad for insurance companies,  but it's good for stocks. "
183,0:26:51,0:26:57,SPEAKER 1," Bad for insurance companies.  And what happens to the insurance companies as a result?  Are they getting more?  Well, some insurance companies kind of put them at risk. "
184,0:26:57,0:27:19,BUFFETT," The ones that really get hurt are either life or annuity companies that have promised returns.  The property casualty business doesn't promise returns.  It still holds money,  so it hurts them.  But if you promise somebody an annuity that's going to pay them 3 or 4 percent,  and now you find that you're reinvesting your money at 1 percent or something,  you're going to disappear. "
185,0:27:20,0:27:25,SPEAKER 1," Are insurance companies being forced to make riskier and riskier bets?  Well,  they shouldn't.  I mean, the answer, if you need to get 3 percent and you're only getting 1 percent,  the answer is to quit giving 3 percent.  It's not to try and get the 1 up to 3 and do more dangerous things.  You should always adapt your  consumption to your income.  You shouldn't try and adjust your income to your consumption.  That's a basic principle for individuals,  businesses and everything else.  And reaching for yield is really stupid,  but it's very human.  I mean, I understand it.  And people say, well, I've saved all this money all my life and now I can only get 1 percent.  What do I do?  The answer is you learn to live on 1 percent, unfortunately.  And you don't go and listen to some salesman come along and tell you I've got some magic way to get you 5 percent."
186,0:28:18,0:28:24,BUFFETT," Do you think, though, that that's what should be happening?  Do you think that there is more risk taking place in the insurance market?  And you see that in what they call leveraged loans and weaker covenants.  So, no, people are reaching for yield.  There's no question about that.  And that's stupid.  And it has consequences over time.  But it's very human."
187,0:28:40,0:28:43,SPEAKER 1, Consequences that could have a big market impact?
188,0:28:43,0:28:44,BUFFETT, Depends how far it goes.
189,0:28:45,0:28:46,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.
190,0:28:46,0:29:01,BUFFETT," It's the it's  it's something that the things that get built in slowly,  people going crazy and tech companies in the late 1990s,  it can take a lot longer than you think.  But eventually you get to midnight and everything turns to pumpkins and mice. "
191,0:29:02,0:29:18,SPEAKER 1," You know, that's the downside of low interest rates, pensions,  savers,  anybody who gets left in a raw position of that on the alternate side of things.  If rates were to rise rapidly or not,  maybe not even so rapidly,  what does that mean for the federal debt? "
192,0:29:18,0:29:21,BUFFETT," Well, it depends on the average maturity of the debt. "
193,0:29:21,0:29:22,SPEAKER 1," But  our maturities are fairly short.  They've got a lengthened level.  But but if you take  20 trillion and and you're borrowing at 2 percent,  you've got you got 400.  What have you got to do?  Two trillion to 200 billion.  You have 40 billion of the expense.  But if it goes to 5 percent,  you got 100 billion of expense.  I mean, at five percent, you got you got a trillion of expense.  I'm sorry.  It's. "
194,0:29:54,0:30:32,BUFFETT," We are benefiting enormously in our national budget by the fact that interest rates are very low.  And so interest costs has not gone up as you would have anticipated if you were looking at the scene 20 or 30 years ago with the increase in national debt.  But, you know,  Austria issued 100 year bonds,  you know, at  2 percent or thereabouts,  and then they've gone way, way up.  And I think maybe the 1.1 or something like that.  I don't know where they are now.  But it's great if you're a borrower to have to  keep money.  I mean, everybody should refinance their mortgage. "
195,0:30:32,0:30:38,SPEAKER 1," Is that an argument for the Federal Reserve or I'm sorry,  for the Treasury Department here issuing longer,  longer notes? "
196,0:30:56,0:30:56,BUFFETT,"Well, yeah, but I would have said the same thing five or six years ago and been wrong.  But if if we.  Under the president's slope,  it still would cost more to lengthen it out.  But you're lengthening it out at very,  very low rates. And it would be what I would be  inclined to do if I were secretary treasurer.  But I'd have missed a lot of bets in the last 10 years to Warren again for people who are just like,  sure, they're tuning in and they  want to know what you think about this sell off this morning to see the Dow down 700,  800 points in the morning.  What's your reaction when you see something like that?  Well, my reaction is that I like to buy stocks.  So I I don't wish ill on anybody else,  but I like that if they want to sell them to be  cheaper, I prefer it.  So that's a  roughly a 3 percent decline or thereabouts.  I don't know how many 3 percent declines I've had in my lifetime,  but there have been a lot of them.  And I I  can't think of one that you shouldn't have bought on, you know, basically.  That doesn't mean stocks are going to go up or down next week or next month or next year.  But but if there's something if you like to own American businesses,  you're getting a chance to buy a 3 percent cheaper.  I don't consider that a lot cheaper.  I mean, but but but how can it be bad news unless you have to sell stocks?  Now, if you have to sell them for some reason,  it's you're worse off  if you don't have to sell them.  I mean, somebody can come around and offer you a quote on your house today and it could be two percent less than they offered you yesterday.  But if you like the house,  it doesn't make any difference. "
197,0:32:14,0:32:17,SPEAKER 1, Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?
198,0:32:17,0:32:23,BUFFETT," Well, we certainly won't be selling.  And now we may we could easily be buying something.  Sure. "
199,0:32:23,0:32:45,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk a little bit about a Barron's cover story that was just out last week.  The good news on the cover story is they think the Berkshire is worth more than it's selling for right now.  The bad news is they said they think that's in part because there's it's got a big conglomerate discount and they think if you weren't running it,  that it might get broken up.  What's your response to that line of logic?  Well,  conglomerates have had a bad name and for good reason over the years.  I mean, I closed my partnership up  at the end of the 1960s and there was a run,  a very abusive run in conglomerates where they played with numbers and they had dirty pooling,  as they call it,  of accounting.  They wanted to have their stocks up and put out stories to do it so they could issue more stock.  They were kind of chain letter arrangements.  There have been a lot of bad conglomerates and probably disproportionately so compared to the sort of honest to God single industry businesses over time.  We don't think we're that kind of a conglomerate.  We've certainly never wanted to issue shares.  We've never touted shares.  It's done for business reasons in our case.  The interesting thing is, of course,  is the American public has been going wild in their enthusiasm for conglomerates  in the last few years,  if you think about it.  I mean, it's been an  incredibly popular area,  but they call them index funds.  You buy 500 businesses.  I'm trying to figure out what you're talking about. "
200,0:33:49,0:33:52,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, 500 businesses all put together.  I mean, that's the ultimate conglomerate,  isn't it?  I mean, I've recommended index funds to lots of people,  and when they do it,  they're buying into 500 businesses and they're going to have 500 businesses a year from now and five years from now.  And they think that group of businesses will do very well.  And I think our group of businesses will do OK. "
201,0:34:10,0:34:22,SPEAKER 1," The difference with an S&P 500 index is it's 500 different companies run by 500 different management teams who are all focused on their business,  maybe not having a centralized operation that is loosely running all of those. "
202,0:34:22,0:35:49,BUFFETT," Well, we've got our businesses are run by separate people.  I mean, I we just finished Valentine's Day and I did not I did not select what pieces went in the boxes.  And it's been  probably been 10 years at least  since I've been to a C's cannery factory.  Now, I get the figures every month,  but I don't have I don't know how to make chocolate.  I think it was a short I don't pick out the new locations.  We we have managers for our businesses that are very much like the managers we have for the businesses that we own pieces up like American Express or Coca-Cola.  And there's a couple of things we can do.  We can determine the dividend policy of our subsidiaries.  We can control their capital allocation to some extent,  but on most capital allocation, whether to  buy new equipment or anything like that,  they make the decision.  The BNSF Railroad is going to spend three and a half billion dollars on.  I don't I don't approve a single dollar of that in terms of capital expenditures.  They they know what they need to do or they need to lay track how many locomotives they whatever it may be.  So our managers are I would say in a sense,  they're almost more independent than the managers of the S&P 500 who go around and report to Wall Street week after week.  They go to investor relations meeting and they're always explaining what they're doing and trying to get the approval of the analysts and all that sort of thing.  And and we just tell our managers to do what makes sense. "
203,0:35:49,0:35:59,SPEAKER 1," OK, outside of the idea of them not having to report to individual shareholders or the investment community,  what's the advantage of having you there?  The capital allocation part of it? "
204,0:35:59,0:36:56,BUFFETT," Well, we can yeah, we can move capital within.  If you move capital from one stock to another and you had a game,  I mean, you pay a tax and maybe a dividend tax.  So if you sell,  but there's a there's  a lot of taxes incurred in moving from one business to another,  either at the corporate level in some cases,  but certainly at the individual level.  And we can move capital.  Well, just take C's Candy again.  We bought that in 1972.  We've moved  several billion dollars from the candy business to other types of businesses.  And we'd love it if we could use it on the candy business,  but it just isn't that sort of business.  And in addition to that,  we free up our managers from all dealing with Wall Street,  dealing with baggers, dealing with all kinds of things that are what I regard as less productive use of their time. "
205,0:36:57,0:37:21,SPEAKER 1," However, you also have a situation where you have gotten some activists who have been interested in the stock, including Bill Ackman.  He's built up a stake,  hasn't said too much about it,  but I think he has made some comments about how maybe Burlington,  northern Santa Fe's margins could be improved.  You can look back at Bill Ackman's experience with the Canadian Pacific Railway and kind of wonder if he is building up a position because he would like to see you take a more active role there.  Well, we notice what other railroads earn and when their margins are better.  I mean, and we certainly put way less pressure on  than Wall Street might who would want it next week.  But we,  our managers are well aware of what's going on in other industries.  And we've made changes where we don't think some businesses are performing as well as they should.  But overwhelmingly,  we've got managers there that are very, very good. And they've got capital available to them for anything that makes sense. And we decide how much they distribute,  where the capital moves.  And sometimes it moves from one industry to another.  And in certain industries,  a consolidated tax position really is very helpful to us.  There's a viewer question that came in from Ben Comston.  And he asks, it was recently pointed out by Bill Ackman that some subsidiaries like GEICO,  BNSF lagged their peers in some areas.  Would you agree with that?  And how can your successor push improvement in subsidiaries while maintaining a decentralized management structure? "
206,0:38:29,0:39:50,BUFFETT," Well, at GEICO,  we bought control in 1995.  We had about two and a half percent of the market for auto insurance.  And we're at about 13.7 percent of the market.  So we've gone from  two and a half billion of premium volume, or thereabouts,  to 35 billion of premium volume.  We're number two now at a state farm.  We were number  six or seven at that time.  So I would say that not due to Berkshire at all,  but due to Tony Nicely during almost all those years.  GEICO has been the envy of every other company in the  auto insurance business, except for Progressive.  But they've done a good job, too.  But GEICO is worth tens and tens and tens of billions more than when we bought it,  in addition to all the earnings we've gotten,  just the goodwill value.  So that's been extraordinarily well run.  And with  Burlington,  we I think we paid a dividend of five billion last year and we paid 35 billion for it.  So it's gained in market share and its business.  Its operating margins have improved,  but they haven't improved as much as some other railroads. "
207,0:39:51,0:39:53,SPEAKER 1," Do you believe in precision scheduling railroading?   Well, we'll see.  I mean, we've watched it plenty.  And for those who don't know what that is,  it's something that kind of irritates customers because it makes things a little more rigid.  But it does."
208,0:40:04,0:40:13,BUFFETT," Yeah, it makes the customers adapt to the railroad more than the railroad adapting the customers.  And practically everybody's done it.  And a fellow named Hunter Harrison was enormously successful. "
209,0:40:13,0:40:15,SPEAKER 1, He worked with Bill Ackman at the Canadian Pacific.
210,0:40:16,0:40:59,BUFFETT," Yeah, he worked for the BNSF,  if you go back far enough.  He and there's a book about his very own.  But he did it at the Illinois Central,  the Canadian National, the Canadian Pacific.  And then he was going over to the CSX.  He he he developed a method of railroading where the customer does adapt more to the  railroad and improve margins dramatically.  Our margins are close to what the better railroads.  Well, there's only a few that get from precision railroading.  I mean, then we've gained share because the customers don't like because the railroads  apparently or the railroad customers like us better.  And over the  over the long term,  we'll see.  But it isn't like it's something we can't do. "
211,0:41:00,0:44:55,SPEAKER 1," Here's the latest on the coronavirus.  China reported an additional 150 deaths and 409 new cases overnight.  South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after the number of cases there ballooned from 31 to more than 750 in less than a week.  Stocks  in Asia falling overnight.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell one point eight percent.  South Korea's Cosby fell nearly three point nine percent.  Shares of South Korea's two largest airlines down as they canceled flights to the city of Daegu,  where many of the new cases were detected.  Meantime,  Italy's government is scrambling to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of Asia.  Stocks there were lower overnight.  The government placed at least 10 towns in northern Italy under quarantine and canceled the last few days of the Venice Carnival.  Elsewhere in Italy, schools, museums, universities and cinemas were closed and major soccer matches were canceled.  At this point,  I mean, Boris Johnson out earlier today and are saying that the risk to UK citizens just over there remains low.  I would say that  our officials would say that here,  too.  The risk to the U.S.  citizens remains low.  But there's a significant difference between supply chain disruption slowing dozens and dozens and actually hundreds of companies.  Absolutely.  And that's dampening global growth.  What worries me is that we don't know three,  three months, six months, nine months, if it ever gets to the point where we start to see in a lot of  countries around the world,  these these break outs where they don't even know the origin of some of these.  And if they multiply like that,  that's when I think it could really get at this point.  It's still a it's still a global growth slowdown.  Nobody in most of the world is worried that they're going to catch coronavirus.  Right.  And they can't go out and they can't go to the movies or the health club or to a restaurant.  But that I just wonder,  we don't know.  There are major travel that's being changed right now.  Conferences are being canceled.  There was an article in Time magazine speculating when the weather the Olympics in Japan over the summer will be canceled.  So there's real implications here that could reverberate.  Having said that, the farther we get to the spring,  the better it gets in terms of weather.  There's a whole sort of it about how the flu,  you know, you know, I was looking at Jim's some of Jim's tweets earlier.  If you go too far with with the the fear and the panic,  you're accused of one thing.  If you don't go far enough,  you're accused of the other thing.  So we really just need to sit here and each day report on the facts and try to remain attached.  But there's something something about a pandemic that just is different than other black swans.  It's it's it's a frightening prospect.  Anyway, let's get right back to our guest of the morning.  Warren Buffett joins Becky in Omaha following the release of his annual letter to  shareholders over the weekend.  And Becky, you took a plane.  I mean, it's in the back of our minds,  is it?  It's just in the back.  There's no way.  And the risks are low.  It goes back to 1918.  It goes back to 1980.  And if you look at the numbers of what happened in that pandemic when it came around the  globe, up to 50 million people were killed in that.  It was a third of the planet's population that was infected.  It was 500 million people that were infected at that point.  Six hundred seventy five thousand Americans died at that point.  So inevitably,  your mind kind of goes back to what's happened in the past,  because as humans, we always look back to history to try and predict the future.  It doesn't always work.  It's not always prophetic,  but it does give you something  of what to kind of play out if this were to get worse and worse.  Now, Andrew brought up the idea that it's warm weather.  We're approaching spring in a lot of parts of the country,  a lot of parts of the planet  that may be good news.  We just don't know if this time around,  if this is one of those viruses that that does die off in warmer weather.  Wait and see.  Kind of hope.   Yeah, actually,  I  think this from what I've heard from people that know a lot more about viruses than I do, that that that  unfortunately, this will make it through the summer.  And and in terms of having a vaccine,  it's a long ways off.  So you've got  it is scary stuff.  I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks,  but but in terms of in terms of the human race,  it's scary stuff when you have a pandemic.  Yeah, I guess this one's particularly frightening because it's new.  So there's no natural immunity that's built up in any of the populations.  And you wonder what happens,  particularly in areas where there's not the same health care structure that we have in America or in some of the developed nations.  I guess that's a big part of the question, too.  Yeah,  it's  it's.  Well, I think about it in terms of our annual meeting.  I mean, that which is May 2nd.  I mean, it it could very well affect by that time.  It could affect.  We've got questions from viewers asking just that.  Will the annual meeting be any different this year,  particularly because you have a large  Chinese contingency of shareholders? "
212,0:46:07,0:46:21,BUFFETT," Yeah, I don't think that certainly will be affected.  And and incidentally, I mean, flu is particularly tough on old people.  You're going to have two guys on the stage who's  combined ages one hundred eighty five. "
213,0:46:21,0:46:21,SPEAKER 1," So,  yeah, well, we won't be looking for people showing any signs of contagion.  But that's one of the problems with this is it does have a long gestation period and it's highly transmissible. And again, you did talk about it earlier.  It's something that you see in the results of the businesses,  even some of your own fully owned businesses that you didn't anticipate."
214,0:46:43,0:46:47,BUFFETT," Well, we own airlines, for example.  It affects businesses now. "
215,0:46:48,0:46:48,SPEAKER 1," Actually,  my dad used to tell me a story.  He was 14 in 1918 and he told me what went on in Omaha during the  big Spanish flu epidemic.  I mean, it was it was something in those days and and pandemics will.  Occur in the future now,  what they hope to get is is a universal flu vaccine,  but that's a long way off.  It isn't impossible.  I mean, I asked my my own science advisers,  Bill Gates, so I talked to him, I call him.  I've talked to him the last few days about about it.  And he's bullish on the long term outlook for a universal  prevention of it.  But but he says it's not going to come,  you know, for it's not going to be here in 10 years.  What are what are Bill's concerns as somebody who spends a lot of time traveling around the globe,  as somebody who is trying to help medicine in some of the less developed parts of the world? "
216,0:47:49,0:47:49,BUFFETT,"Yeah, the Gates Foundation is  is very active in trying to be helpful on this. And and Bill says the CDC is the best in the world.  And I mean, we've got terrific  resources in this country,  but a pandemic is a pandemic.  And and there's just no evaluating.  But I have heard that  the summer is not likely to  cause the end of this."
217,0:48:11,0:48:12,SPEAKER 1, Do you know why?
218,0:48:12,0:48:20,BUFFETT," But I don't know.  And, you know, you shouldn't be asking.  I shouldn't be offering my opinion on that because I I pass along things I hear from people I think are smart. "
219,0:48:20,0:48:24,SPEAKER 1," But but I'm actually asking for Bill's opinion, not yours.  Well,  well,  I shouldn't and I shouldn't really quote him,  but I do.  He's the guy I ask.  And I did talk to just a few days ago.  And he loves to talk science and he can make it so I can understand it,  which is quite a trick.  You know,  at the Gates Foundation,  they're taking it very seriously.  I'll put it that way.  Is money going from the Gates Foundation to try and find a vaccine? "
220,0:48:48,0:48:51,BUFFETT, I'm sure we are expending human and financial resources.
221,0:48:53,0:49:02,SPEAKER 1," Have I mean, maybe this is more than,  you know, but, you know, if they have put human resources out either into China or other places where they don't know that. "
222,0:49:02,0:49:15,BUFFETT, I don't want to comment on that.  But I know that there that that is something they've always spent.  They've been very involved in is human health and and even particularly this bill knows a lot about vaccines.
223,0:49:16,0:49:32,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk a little bit about Berkshire Hathaway.  We were in the middle of a conversation when we had to go to a break before.  But there has been this question raised not only by Barron's in the cover story there,  but by other places, too,  about whether Berkshire Hathaway would be worth more if it were split up. "
224,0:49:32,0:51:23,BUFFETT," That's a good question.  And I will tell you that that  if you were to say and let's say the stock market didn't change for two years and interest rates didn't change.  So you had a two year period and you said we'll sell off all the businesses.  I don't think  I mean, you have the expenses of selling them now.  If you sold them all to people who leveraged them up to their maximum,  you might get a little more than the stock is selling for.  It would be very tax inefficient,  very tax inefficient.  Interestingly enough,  up till 1986,  it wouldn't have been.  I mean, there was a general utilities doctrine that governed corporate breakups.  And so you could dispose of  businesses or securities.  If you did it right,  you could dispose of securities or businesses that are appreciated  without a tax at the corporate level.  That was done regularly in various ways up till 1986.  They revised the tax code big time.  They killed general utilities.  You can't do that now.  Now you can go you can have spinoffs,  this business or that business.  You probably have to lie a little in terms of your purpose in order to  get the best tax ruling.  And it takes time.  But you cannot break up.  You cannot dispose of the entire business,  business by business,  without having very substantial tax liability.  It would not produce a gain.  On the other hand,  having them together produces there's some very valuable synergies in there.  Now, we don't use leverage as much as the people who would buy them piece by piece would do.  So we could leverage  Berkshire up to the sky.  I promise people we won't because we have insurance promises to people out 50 or 100 years and we've got shareholders are going to own the stock for 50 years and they do not want us to  to leverage to the sky. "
225,0:51:23,0:51:23,SPEAKER 1," But  there would not be a profit if if  we were simply to announce that over the next 24 months that you could come in and buy any business we had and we'd sell them to the highest bidder.  You made a point of talking about this in the annual letter.  You said key to my only Berkshire key to my Berkshire only institutions is my faith in the future judgment of fidelity of Berkshire directors.  They will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees and many companies.  These super salesmen might win.  I do not,  however, expect this to happen. "
226,0:51:54,0:53:15,BUFFETT," That's exactly true.  And I think by writing it,  it helps a little too.  No, there's no question that that Wall Street would love to come along and sell anything that we've got.  I mean, there's a fee every time that there's a transaction and they're big fees and there's fees for financing.  I mean, there's so we've had all kinds of  people snoop around that they know they're not getting done with me,  but they won't get done later on either.  I am leaving every every share of Berkshire goes to charity and it's ninety nine percent of my net worth.  So I got  nobody cares more than I do about getting the most money to those philanthropies over the four of the years following my death.  And that's going to take place over 15 years.  And I say keep it all in Berkshire.  But if I thought that it was going to be run in a way responsive to  Wall Street, I would I would instead do something else and have the money distributed to these philanthropies and not have it all tied to Berkshire.  But Berkshire has a very unusual shareholder base.  I mean, we have individuals that own Berkshire and a lot of them have owned it 50 years.  Just like it's people buy it to own for a lifetime.  And and we're going to run it in a way that they won't be disappointed. "
227,0:53:15,0:53:24,SPEAKER 1," Do you think the people who are newer,  relatively newer shareholders buying the B shares have the same mentality as the people who have been in it for 50 years? "
228,0:53:24,0:54:44,BUFFETT," Well, we try to because that's who we encourage.  I mean, in effect,  we don't want everybody to buy our stock.  I mean, there's only so many seats.  There's about a million six hundred and some thousand a shares out.  All the seats are filled.  I love the shareholders we have.  I don't want to go to Wall Street and try and get some new shareholders  to replace the people we have.  So what we want to have is people in those seats that are in sync with us.  You can run a French restaurant or you can run a hamburger stand.  And if you serve good hamburgers,  you'll do good business.  They have a standing at the French restaurant.  You do the same thing there.  But you can't run the French restaurant and serve hamburgers inside.  And you can't run the hamburger stand and serve French food inside.  So we advertise in our deeds,  in our words and every way we can what we're about.  And we're looking to have the seats filled at our church  by people who are in sync with us.  And we do have them there.  We get the same people every Sunday.  And I see no advantage in going out and telling everybody in Wall Street we're going to do wonderful things and having those seats replaced,  because the only way you can get a seat is to throw somebody else out of that seat.  There's only so many seats and they're all full.  And you want them filled with people who are in sync  with the with the policies of the company.  And therefore, you have to explain those policies and you have to live up to those policies.  And for 55 years,  we've tried to. "
229,0:54:45,0:54:55,SPEAKER 1," So you get the shareholders you deserve.  Exactly.  All right.  Not to mix metaphors,  but can you have a decentralized central office running both the French restaurant and the hamburger place?  Well,  they aren't trying.  We're not trying to have the railroad management run the utility.  You're decentralized.  That's what I mean.  A decentralized headquarters that's in charge,  a conglomerate in charge of all those different businesses. "
230,0:55:06,0:55:18,BUFFETT," Well, we could run.  Well, we have decentralized management as it is.  We could have somebody in charge of all the little companies,  another one for the big.  I mean, we could visualize it in all kinds of ways.  I think we'd have more overhead.  I think we'd have a different sort of manager.  Our managers like running their own businesses and they they like  they never have to finance their businesses.  I mean, they never have to go to Wall Street.  They never they probably save 25 percent of their time.  And and I want them to feel they own their businesses.  And that's all they're responsible for.  If we mess up some other way, you know,  they still they get paid based on how they do.  And and there again,  we attract managers who like to operate on that basis.  We don't attract managers,  particularly who think they're going to keep moving step by step  through various divisions and eventually run the whole place. "
231,0:56:07,0:56:39,SPEAKER 1," One of the things that people wrote in,  a lot of people had questions about the banks,  about what's happening with the banks,  what you've changed with some of your investments over time.  Jason Goldberg writes in,  he says, please ask more about his views on the bank stocks in general and on Wells Fargo in particular.  Over the last two quarters,  he sold almost a quarter of his longstanding Wells Fargo stake.  Also in the fourth quarter,  he dumped a third of his Goldman stock Goldman Sachs shares,  although he still owns over seventy five billion dollars in bank equities.  So what do you think about banks?  Not necessarily the sell off today because you don't look at day by day.  Well,  banking is a good business if you don't do dumb things on the asset side."
232,0:56:43,0:56:43,BUFFETT," I mean, basically,  and it's a business that the banks we own earn between  the commercial banks earn between 12 percent  and 16 percent or so on  tangible assets.  That's a good business.  It's a fantastic business against  the long term bond.  You know, a two percent.  If you have a choice between a two percent instrument and a 12 percent instrument,  which one is going to win over time?  So,  so if you ask me whether I think banks are going to go down where they only earn three or four percent on tangible assets,  I don't think that'll happen.  The question is really whether they do something massively dumb.  I mean, which periodically a number of banks have done.  And I feel very good about the banks we own.  They're  they're very attractive compared to most other securities I see.  And and most of them are buying Bank of America is buying in a lot of stock every year.  So our ownership of the Bank of America this year probably will go up seven or eight percent without a spending a dime.  I'd like to own any business,  any good business where my ownership is up seven or eight percent every year without me spending any money.  And on top of it, I get a dividend.  So they're very they're very attractive,  both against interest rates and against or against bonds and against other stocks, in my view. "
233,0:58:13,0:58:31,SPEAKER 1," You say occasionally they do dumb things.  Maybe you're talking about Wells Fargo with the scandal that it had.  It just settled on Friday with a number of the regulatory institutions that were kind of looking into it,  the investigations that were taking place for three billion dollars.  Does this mean that they have kind of finally gotten through that and can move forward? "
234,0:58:32,0:58:36,BUFFETT, I don't know the answer to that.  I know that they paid three billion because it was announced.  I don't know what else is outstanding.
235,0:58:37,0:58:37,SPEAKER 1," But  Wells Fargo is classic in in in terms of one lesson.  My partner, Charlie, he says whenever we have a problem,  you attack it immediately.  He says an ounce of perversion,  an ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure.  An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.  And we've seen that time after time. And the interesting thing I and I don't know the details at all, but  the original thing was a bunch of a whole bunch of phony accounts.  Now, I don't know how if you open up a couple of million phony accounts,  you make any money on it at all.  I mean, I don't the shareholders didn't make money.  People say that, well, the incentive structure was set up so that some of the employees  don't have a system.  You can think and as soon as you learn,  you can devise dumb incentive systems.  We've done ourselves.  I mean, you can you can cause people to do the wrong thing because they will do what they're incented to do.  And they had obviously a very dumb incentive system.  People started playing it various ways.  And the big thing is they ignored it when they found out about it.  I mean, you're going to do dumb things in business and we do them every day.  You know, but the you absolutely have to attack a problem  as soon as it occurs.  And you know about it. And if that had happened,  Wells Fargo shareholders would be a lot better off.  But Wells Fargo shareholders did not did not profit from opening up accounts that were phony accounts that had nothing in them.  I mean, somebody was getting paid so much per account.  So and the practice spread because bad practices do spread if they're allowed to spread.  And they were ignored, which is  a total disaster.  And and look at the consequences.  So two or three years later, who's paying?  The shareholders are paying for something that didn't do them any good whatsoever.  Is that why you've sold off some of the shares? "
236,1:00:28,1:00:29,BUFFETT," No, not specifically. "
237,1:00:30,1:00:34,SPEAKER 1, I know you don't want to get specific on why.
238,1:00:34,1:00:39,BUFFETT," No, I'm not.  I'm not recommending what stocks people have to make up their own minds on that. "
239,1:00:39,1:01:14,SPEAKER 1," But OK,  I want to ask you a question about Todd Combs and his new role at Geico.  I got several questions that came in from that.  And let's just use this one from Peter Lampras.  During last year's interview on CNBC,  after the 2018 letter was released,  you were asked about succession at Geico.  And you mentioned that at a recent meeting at Geico,  you met about 40 of their top executives.  And after each introduced themselves,  they stated their length of time with the company.  The shortest was 19 years.  Please explain why none of these 40 top executives were qualified to take over as CEO after the retirement of Bill Roberts.  Again, that's Pete Lampras from Chicago.   Bill Roberts took over.  Not even two years ago and last and he has done a terrific job in connection with Tony.  And I mean,  Geico is my first love.  Absolutely.  I tell the other companies that you can't compete for my second love,  but you can't compete for my first love,  which is Geico, because it goes back 60,  69 years.  And it did wonderful.  Anyway,  Geico,  Bill Roberts took over a little less than two years ago.  And then in either October or November last year,  he said he would he'd like to retire in a year.  He would  adjust it in any way that  made it the easiest for us.  And and we did not have the person,  in my view,  to replace him at that point.  And Todd Combs,  who's worked with Berkshire now for 10 years,  he actually was a product manager at Progressive in the past.  And he knows a lot about insurance.  Insurance is probably the only business I know something about that we're in.  All the rest of them are full of confusion.  But I understand the insurance business to some degree.  Todd understands it very well at the operating level.  And so Todd is there.  And I hope very much that that he's not there very long because I'd like to get him back to Omaha.  But our intention always is to promote from within.  And we would hope to pick out the right person at Geico.  It isn't that there isn't somebody there.  It's just you want to have the right one,  because when you put somebody in,  you're going to keep them there for a long time.  And or her.  And does that suggest Todd is not going to be there for a long time?"
240,1:03:01,1:03:14,BUFFETT," I don't think he's going to know.  No, the plan is not for him to be.  I mean, he has not made a permanent career shift.  And he you know,  I don't know how long he'll be there. "
241,1:03:14,1:03:14,SPEAKER 1," We have  we have one important problem, which is  which all insurance companies have.  But "
242,1:03:21,1:03:36,BUFFETT, Progressive has done a better job of of managing of of of  of correlating or risk with with rate.  And that  is what we're focused on now.
243,1:03:37,1:03:38,SPEAKER 1, Correlating risk with rate.
244,1:03:38,1:03:40,BUFFETT," In other words, having the proper rate. "
245,1:03:40,1:03:41,SPEAKER 1, Right.  Charging the right amount.
246,1:03:41,1:03:57,BUFFETT," Charging the right amount.  If you were in the life insurance business and you thought that 80 year olds had the same life expectancy as 20 year olds,  you'd have a big problem.  And what would happen is you'd write all the 80 year olds and somebody would write all the 20 year olds.  So in auto insurance,  the same thing.  There's a vast difference. "
247,1:03:57,1:04:00,SPEAKER 1, Auto insurance.  I'm not sure I might prefer the 80 year olds over the 20.
248,1:04:00,1:04:52,BUFFETT," Well, you might.  And you certainly would prefer the 80 year olds to the 16 year olds.  I mean, yeah.  And you'd prefer the 16 year old female to the 16 year old male.  There's a whole bunch of things.  So you've got a core.  You really got to segment risks.  And that's enormously important.  And every company is trying to do it better all the time.  And we do it far better than we did 50 years ago.  But we have room for improvement on that.  We're focused on that.  And in the meantime,  we're growing faster.  We're gaining market share.  Geico is a fantastic asset.  Todd's job is to focus on that,  but it's also to work himself out of a job very,  very quickly and preferably to work.  Definitely, preferably to work himself out of a job with somebody from Geico. "
249,1:04:52,1:05:07,SPEAKER 1," Eric Lafont writes a follow up question.  He says, Warren, why did you and Ajit decide to appoint Todd Combs as the CEO of Geico?  That part you've answered.  But how will he be able to run Geico,  manage a 13 billion dollar investment portfolio,  oversee Haven and be on the board of J.P.  Morgan? "
250,1:05:07,1:05:12,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, let's get it'll keep him busy.  And we've told him he's unlimited use of a net jet. "
251,1:05:12,1:05:13,SPEAKER 1, So really?
252,1:05:13,1:05:45,BUFFETT," Oh, sure.  No, I mean, we want him to be efficient.  That's what that just is for.  And and and he'll be working 70 hour weeks.  The the question about the portfolio is interesting.  Most months,  neither Ted nor Todd makes a single change in their portfolio.  I mean, portfolio management is something that you learn over decades.  And when I ran Solomon,  I was running Berkshire portfolio.  It is not something that you have to sit there day by day and do.  People do it that way. "
253,1:05:46,1:05:46,SPEAKER 1," But.   If  there are many years where if I just left the portfolio entirely the same and didn't make any changes,  we'd be better off.  So it that's not about.  But but you're right in terms of J.P.  Morgan's board.  He's he's going to be a very busy guy.  Geico is the top priority,  but it isn't going to say the top priority for a long, long time.  And let me run to another question that Max 0205 wrote in.  Have Todd Combs and Ted Weschler outperformed the S&P 500 since they began working at Berkshire?  Why don't you disclose their record?"
254,1:06:21,1:06:22,BUFFETT, Why don't I?
255,1:06:22,1:06:24,SPEAKER 1," Why don't you disclose their record?  They said, well,  we're not disclosing.  I think it would be very unusual for a firm to discover disclose everybody's sales last year.  Among their salespeople or anything like that.  I mean, they're entitled to work in relative  anonymity.  Our directors know how they do.  I know how they do.  We made a lot of money with them.  I feel very good.  I mean, I feel very good about them in all ways.  But we're not going to we're not going to tell you how much each candy store sells.  It's sees candy or who was the top the top person that  at any place brought in the sales or whatever it may be.  All right.  Let's jump to Berkshire's overall record versus S&P.  Berkshire has now underperformed the S&P 500 on one year,  three year, five year and 10 year marks.  Yeah.  Is that because it's too big and will it ever be able to outperform? "
256,1:07:16,1:08:04,BUFFETT," Well, certainly being too big as part of it.  And but I would say this  during that same time.  I mean, last year we achieved now I don't like it.  Gap earnings very well,  but we achieved the highest  gap earnings of any company in the world has ever achieved.  That's investor owned.  And we have the highest net worth of any company in the world.  Investor owned any company in the world.  So it.  I would say.  Related to safety of principle over time,  I feel good about it and I feel good about the fact  that 99 percent of my money is in it and that  it will be the source of all the philanthropic  contributions that are made for 15 or dozen years after I die. "
257,1:08:04,1:08:04,SPEAKER 1, So.
258,1:08:05,1:08:21,BUFFETT, But I don't think  I do not think  it will be in the top 10 percent  of stocks performing over the next 10 years.  I don't think it'll be in the top 15 percent of stocks performing in the next  10 or 15 years.  I also don't think it'll be in the bottom 10 percent or 20 percent or 30 percent.
259,1:08:21,1:08:21,SPEAKER 1, So.
260,1:08:22,1:08:34,BUFFETT," But our ability to  have a huge edge over the market generally with a 550 billion dollar market value.  It's just  it'll be minor, but it'll be done in a very, very safe manner. "
261,1:08:35,1:08:39,SPEAKER 1, Is an investment in the S&P 500 a better investment?  It could be.  It could be.
262,1:08:39,1:09:17,BUFFETT," You know,  on balance, I think we'll do a little better, but it'll be.  It'll be minor, depends on the kind of market where we're in a down market.  We're going to beat it.  I mean, it's that simple.  And sometimes we will be the last 10 years we haven't been.  But  over 55 years, it's worked and it will continue working,  but it will not work at all like it did  when we were working with 100 million dollars or a billion dollars.  There's no question about that.  But we've got good businesses and we're.  We won't be in the bottom quarter.  I promise you that over any long period of time. "
263,1:09:18,1:09:52,SPEAKER 1," There are people like there were back in 1999 who have said maybe you've lost your edge.  It was a similar thing in 1999 where you saw the technology stocks that were the big high flyers that people were pouring their money into the dot com companies and a lot of others associated with that.  If you look at the markets again,  it's the technology companies that have the big runs.  This time you're participating in Apple,  which is one of those front runners.  But is this a cyclical thing to you?  You think there'll be another market downturn and then there'll be a downturn sometime.  And then Berkshire outperforms at that point or will outperform in a down market.  But  but that may not be particularly satisfactory to people.  But no, we will, because we have these businesses are making money.  And I mean, we are we are not  we're geared somewhat away from a full market  participation on in either direction.  But that's fine.  We own if you think about it,  we're 80 some percent in equities.  We may so show two hundred and thirty or forty billion in equities and that looks like we're against our market cap.  We're 40 percent, but we own 100 percent of these other businesses.  Those are equities, too.  I mean, we own a right and we own insurance companies and those are those are equities.  So we're about 80 percent in  roughly in equities and about 20 percent in cash.  And I'd rather I'd rather have that 20 percent and other good businesses.  But but that is to some extent a curse of size.  And it's to some extent the fact that that.  It's very hard if interest rates stay at this level,  we'll wish we'd for the next 10 or 20 years,  we'll wish we'd been one hundred and twenty five percent in equities.  I mean, you know, equities are so much cheaper than bonds, long bonds,  that.  You know, some something will change in a major way.  I just don't know what.  And I want to be prepared for anything, obviously.  So that's why you keep so much cash around.  You want to be able to be prepared for a downturn.  You want to be prepared for a crisis. "
264,1:11:20,1:11:58,BUFFETT," We want to be prepared for anything.  We want to be prepared for pandemics.  We want to be prepared for anything comes along.  Now, that is the chief job I have.  I have people's money.  They gave it to me 50 or 60 years ago and some of them still have 100 percent of their money or essentially.  And and the one thing and I've got the responsibility for five foundations that presently are going to get 80 billion.  And I think we'll get a lot more over time.  Probably.  We don't want to permanently lose money.  And you don't want to get that so that you go into a shell and don't do anything. "
265,1:11:59,1:11:59,SPEAKER 1," But  we have obligations to people on workers' compensation claims and auto accidents.  They've had to go out 50 years.  And,  you know, we have to run the place so that every check clears under any circumstances.  And that's why we incidentally own Treasury bills.  We don't we don't own commercial paper.  We don't rely on bank lines or anything.  When people get terrified and they will occasionally everything freezes.  And you're going to have to stand on your own feet at a time like that.  It won't happen very often,  but it'll happen occasionally.  I know you've developed a thick skin over the years,  but does it tick you off  when people start questioning whether you've lost it,  whether you can still.   Well, I'm sure I've lost some of it.  I can tell you all kinds of things I've lost.  No, that happens.  But we haven't lost  Geico or the railroads.  Berkshire without me is worth essentially the same as Berkshire with me.  I mean, my value added is not high,  but"
266,1:13:02,1:13:32,BUFFETT," I don't think I'm subtracting value.  But the big thing is how our businesses do and what what what we get to add in the way of businesses over time.  And we can add them to marketable securities.  I mean, we own five and a half or a little over a percent of Apple.  It's probably the best business I know in the world.  And we own five and a half percent of it.  And that is a bigger  commitment that we have in anything except insurance  and the railroad.  So it's it's our third largest business. "
267,1:13:33,1:13:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  I made the point that it was bigger than your biggest acquisition of precision.
268,1:13:36,1:13:38,BUFFETT," Oh, sure.  Now it's our third largest business. "
269,1:13:38,1:13:52,SPEAKER 1," All  right.  Let me test you on your thick skin.  Wow.  Here was the kicker of that Barron's cover story.  He said there's reasons to think that the company will be a market beater when he's gone.  In the meantime, happy 90th. "
270,1:13:52,1:14:07,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, that's I hope it is a market beater.  Well, I'm counting on I'm telling my estate and then the trustees that succeed my executors in the state.  I'm telling them to keep every share of Berkshire they have until they have this pattern of giving it away. "
271,1:14:07,1:14:08,SPEAKER 1," I mean,  I want them to look back and say,  gee, we should have made this change earlier because it's going to determine,  you know, how much we buy in the way of vaccines and,  you know, and all kinds of things,  education and all these things.  And I feel terrific about Berkshire after I leave.  I want to talk about another issue that we have not touched on yet,  and that's politics here in the United States.  We just watched the Nevada caucus.  Bernie Sanders walked away with the most delegates after that.  He looks to be as the clear front runner for the nomination for the Democrats this time around.  You have long been a supporter of the Democratic Party.  What do you think? "
272,1:14:50,1:15:21,BUFFETT," Well, I think I'm going to wait and see who gets the nomination,  but I'm a Democrat,  but I'm not a card carrying Democrat.  And I've voted for Republicans.  I've contributed to Republicans.  In fact,  I've only run for two offices in my life.  One was head of the young Republicans at the University of Pennsylvania.  And the other time I was actually on the ballot running for a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1960.  But normally I vote for Democrats and we will see what happens. "
273,1:15:22,1:15:25,SPEAKER 1, Wow.  That's the first time I've ever heard you say something like that.
274,1:15:25,1:15:29,BUFFETT," Well, I've kept it a secret for all these years,  but now it comes out. "
275,1:15:29,1:15:32,SPEAKER 1, You just said that you're not a card carrying Democrat.
276,1:15:32,1:15:32,BUFFETT, That's true.
277,1:15:33,1:15:37,SPEAKER 1, You are a card carrying capitalist.  You actually have one of those in your wallet.  I've seen it.
278,1:15:38,1:15:48,BUFFETT," I don't know whether I'm a card carrying capitalist, right?  I don't think that's consistent with inconsistent with what I've said on politics.  Here it is.  I don't know whether that shows. "
279,1:15:48,1:15:50,SPEAKER 1," Those who can't see,  I'll show you on this camera right here. "
280,1:15:50,1:15:50,BUFFETT," Card carrying capitalist.   This is what you carry in your wallet.  Yeah.  And I think I think we will have some of those available at the annual meeting, too.  For our shareholders."
281,1:15:58,1:16:13,SPEAKER 1," I think Andrew's got a question that he wanted to jump in with here.  Andrew,  I was just going to follow up on that question,  Warren, which was about a year ago.  We had asked you about Michael Bloomberg and you had said that if he ever  entered the race, he was somebody you would support.  Would you support him?  Is he your candidate? "
282,1:16:14,1:16:25,BUFFETT," Well, I would say I would certainly I would certainly vote for him.  I don't think I don't think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. "
283,1:16:26,1:16:26,SPEAKER 1," But  sure, I would I would have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg. And what do you think his chances are?"
284,1:16:37,1:17:40,BUFFETT," Well, I don't think I want to get into handicapping the race,  but I would say this in terms of Sanders.  I actually agree with him in terms of certain things he would  like to accomplish.  I don't agree with him in many ways.  But in terms of the fact that that  we ought to do better by the people that get left behind by our capitalist system,  I don't think we  should kill the capital system in the process.  I think we should make sure that the Golden Goose  keeps laying more eggs.  And it's worked wonderfully since 1776.  But it doesn't work as well for people  whose talents aren't really geared to a market economy.  And I don't think anybody should be left  behind by an economy that has over sixty thousand dollars of GDP per capita.  And so I'm a big fan of increasing the earned income tax credit.  And I'm I'm you  know, I think there should be some changes made.  But but if given the choice,  I wouldn't certainly vote for Mike Bloomberg as opposed to Sanders. "
285,1:17:41,1:18:01,SPEAKER 1," There is a plan.  Let's talk about some of Sanders plans.  You said you agree with some of  what his intentions are.  But let's talk about some of those actual plans.  One of those plans would be to give 20 percent of company stock to employees and put workers on the board.  What do you think about that?  That would be for any company,  public company that has more than 100 million dollars in annual revenue or 100 million dollar balance. "
286,1:18:01,1:18:06,BUFFETT," Well, I don't want to get involved in evaluating this whole plan,  but I think that would be a particularly bad idea. "
287,1:18:06,1:18:07,SPEAKER 1, Because?
288,1:18:08,1:19:28,BUFFETT," Well, I just I don't think that I don't think putting 20 percent of the capitalists out of labor unions is a good idea.  And I I think the market system works very,  very well in terms of developing more goods and services.  I mean, when you flew out here to Omaha,  if you'd flown out here and you wouldn't be able to fly in 1776,  you wouldn't have seen anything.  Everything you see is the product of a system that's worked like nothing's ever worked in the history of the world.  So I do not believe in messing up  our system of developing output.  I do believe that  that anybody is willing to work 40 hours a week and has a couple of kids should not have to have an extra second job.  And I believe in having a higher income for people,  not necessarily a higher minimum wage,  but I do not think it's at all unreasonable that the income tax credit produces at least as 15 dollars an hour,  maybe higher in certain areas.  Is it so I  I'm in very much in sympathy with the fact that that that  Senator Sanders believes that a lot of people are getting left behind and through no fault of their own.  And there's all kinds of aspects of capitalism that can need in some ways to be  regulated.  But I don't believe in giving up the capitalistic system. "
289,1:19:28,1:19:41,SPEAKER 1, All right.  Let me slip in some questions that viewers have written in on this front.  Michael Blank writes in.  Please ask Warren if he thinks the market will sell off if it becomes clear that Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic nomination.  I think
290,1:19:42,1:19:48,BUFFETT," I normally would never make a comment on something like that,  but I would say that. "
291,1:19:48,1:19:50,SPEAKER 1, If.
292,1:19:51,1:20:12,BUFFETT," You had  Sanders and a Democratic House and Senate.  Or if you had Trump with a Republican House and Senate.  There would be a significant difference.  But I don't think I would necessarily vote on what.  In fact, I know I wouldn't vote  on what I thought necessarily would affect the market. "
293,1:20:12,1:20:12,SPEAKER 1, The better.
294,1:20:12,1:20:24,BUFFETT, I think it's a very poor yardstick.  I would not want to cast my vote in a presidential election based on  which would be better for the market in the next 30 or 60 or 90 days after the election.
295,1:20:24,1:20:32,SPEAKER 1," But your reservations with Bernie Sanders,  I assume, come with your concerns about what it means for the economy,  not over 30, 60, 90 days over a much broader period. "
296,1:20:32,1:20:40,BUFFETT," Certain aspects of the economy,  certain things I'd like to see done.  I would like to see the earned income tax credit chain dramatically upward. "
297,1:20:42,1:20:48,SPEAKER 1," Alan Bucky writes in a letter,  he says, if Michael Bloomberg becomes the Democratic candidate,  would you consider buying his company? "
298,1:20:48,1:20:52,BUFFETT," No,  I can give you a categorical answer. "
299,1:20:54,1:21:21,SPEAKER 1," Because of the price,  because of the.  That'd be that'd be something.  Pay more.  And we've talked this morning about the coronavirus.  But there are people who are waking up across the country now kind of tuning in at this  hour.  So maybe we should address this again with the markets indicated down 750 points  with concerns about coronavirus spreading and now worries about what that will mean for the  global economy this year.  I know this is not something you look at a day by day basis,  but how do you kind of wake  up and read this and think through it? "
300,1:21:22,1:22:00,BUFFETT," I don't think it makes no difference in our investments.  I mean, there's always going to be some news,  good or bad, every day.  In fact, if you go back and read all the papers for the last 50 years,  probably most of the headlines tend to be bad.  But but if you look at what happens to the economy,  most of the things happen are extremely good.  I mean, it's incredible what will happen over time.  So if the  if somebody came and told me that the global growth rate was going to be down 1 percent instead of a tenth of a percent,  I'd still buy stocks if I felt like the business and I like the price at which they and I like the price better today than I liked them last Friday. "
301,1:22:01,1:22:05,SPEAKER 1," Do you like prices better today?  Will Berkshire be buying stock today?  Well,  we'll certainly be more inclined to buy stock today than on Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah. "
302,1:22:12,1:22:17,BUFFETT," Anything we were buying Friday,  we will be buying today.  And and feeling better about buying it. "
303,1:22:17,1:22:35,SPEAKER 1," You know, one of the things you talked about in the annual letter was  stock buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway.  Right.  And for the first time you told people to call Mark Millard in your office  outright if they have 20 million dollars worth of Berkshire shares and they're ready to sell.  Right.  That's a really unusual move.  Why did you do that? "
304,1:22:35,1:23:00,BUFFETT," Well, we did it because  it's very hard to buy blocks  in the market of Berkshire.  We probably never see blocks except we do see them from  estates or occasionally.  But if somebody is going to sell 100 million shares,  100 million dollars worth of Berkshire and we want to buy it,  we'd like them to call us.  And if it's if it's if we're buying at that price level,  we'll be buying.  We'll buy it. "
305,1:23:01,1:23:04,SPEAKER 1," Dan Mahoney actually wrote in with a very similar question.  He just said, is it hard to buy back the shares? "
306,1:23:05,1:23:57,BUFFETT," It's harder to buy back Berkshire shares than,  say, Bank of America is buying back their shares.  Bank of America bought back eight or nine percent of their stock last year and they can really do it without moving the market.  I mean, Apple's been buying back a ton of stock.  They were buying stock at the same time we were buying stock.  But it was easier for us to buy Apple stock,  even though Apple itself was buying a lot of stock than it is to buy Berkshire.  Berkshire is,  well, it's held by people that really plan to keep it.  There's I think the amount of speculation in Berkshire stock is relatively low compared to most stocks.  And so it's it's it's it's  well, we bought five billion dollars worth last year,  but that's only one percent of the market cap.  And and I would say with a great many companies,  you can buy four or five percent of the company fairly easily a year without disturbing the market.  American Express has been buying it every year. "
307,1:23:58,1:24:05,SPEAKER 1," So with you putting out an ad in the letter to shareholders,  does that basically mean you are eager to buy more shares back? "
308,1:24:05,1:24:24,BUFFETT," Depends on the price.  But but we'll let anybody know if we told them to call us before the opening or after the close.  But but and only if only with blocks and only if they're ready to do business.  Now, there'll be a few people probably that probably try and call just to see whether we're buying or not.  We will we will not show a lot of patience with those people. "
309,1:24:24,1:24:36,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk about shares of Apple,  both from you just mentioning it with the share buybacks,  with it being such a huge holding of yours.  You've got more than five point three percent of the company right now. "
310,1:24:36,1:24:40,BUFFETT," I think five, six, but I went six and it goes up every day. "
311,1:24:40,1:24:59,SPEAKER 1," Let's talk about what we've seen with the slowdown with the coronavirus,  because Apple is one of the companies that has said it's going to have an impact not only with the stores that they've closed there with the behavior of Chinese customers,  but also what happens with the supply chain.  I change.  Sure.  How do you read through any of that?  What are you hearing?  Do you know more than we do on?  No,  no. "
312,1:24:59,1:25:31,BUFFETT," I don't know one thing more.  I see I may see Tim Cook at the annual meeting.  I see him in Sun Valley once a year.  No, I I don't think.  I don't think I've placed a phone call to Tim Cook in two or three years or I mean, no, I it  all kinds of things are going to happen to Apple over the next 10 years.  The real question is, is,  you know, what is the degree of pervasiveness and strength of that product five or 10 years from now?  And I don't think of Apple as a stock.  I think it's our third largest business. "
313,1:25:32,1:25:39,SPEAKER 1, It's also a high flying technology company.  It's one that's been at the forefront.  But you've said in the past you didn't buy it because it's a technology company.
314,1:25:39,1:25:43,BUFFETT," I think it's a consumer products.  In fact, I think I said this on the program a couple of years ago. "
315,1:25:43,1:25:44,SPEAKER 1," I mean, it is  obviously it's a consumer product company that uses technology,  but we've got a lot of products that use technology that at Berkshire.  But it's an incredible company.  And I should have appreciated it earlier.  There's a question that came in from I  guess the handle is GPG.  This is a question that came in on Twitter.  And the writer asks,  you've said that you can do fair value estimates of companies.  You follow it any time in your head.  So please do one now for Apple.  What went wrong with your estimate for IBM?  And how is that a miscalculation?  Different than for Apple?  Well,  IBM is an entirely different business than Apple.  I mean,  Apple doesn't resemble IBM anymore.  It resembles Seed Candy way more.  I mean, it is a incredibly useful product to people that grows more useful as the number of people are involved.  I mean,  it's really interesting.  You know, we call them smartphones.  If  you go back and look at the old telephone,  that was an incredible useful.  It changed my mother's life and my dad's.  It changed lives in every way.  And they they took a long time to become pervasive and it was very expensive initially.  But  it it changed the world.  And the smartphone is part of  hundreds and hundreds of millions of people's lives.  And all aspects of their lives that they it's used for as all kinds of utility.  It's a consumer product.  Are you a consumer of its products at this point?  You've had a flip phone for forever.  Ah,  I'm glad you brought that up.  I am now using not very often.  I'm using the latest model.  And I'll give you a little preview of our our movie for the annual meeting.  We haven't done it yet,  but it will probably showing me crushing with my foot,  my old flip phone while closing up to the new smartphone.  When did you get a smartphone? "
316,1:27:52,1:27:59,BUFFETT," I've been given several of them,  but including by Tim Cook. "
317,1:28:01,1:28:04,SPEAKER 1, One finally stuck.  What?  One finally stuck.  You're right.
318,1:28:04,1:28:11,BUFFETT," Yeah, absolutely.  No, I my flip phone is permanently gone.  The number's been changed to my new phone. "
319,1:28:11,1:28:12,SPEAKER 1," Yeah,  that's impressive. "
320,1:28:13,1:28:18,BUFFETT," I mean, you're looking at an eighty nine year old guy that's barely beginning to be with it. "
321,1:28:19,1:28:23,SPEAKER 1, What do you like best about the phone?  And what do you like least?
322,1:28:24,1:28:40,BUFFETT," Well, I don't I don't use all its facilities like most people.  I mean, most people are living their lives around it.  And I use it as a phone as a phone and I use it as a phone.  I don't like investment bankers talk about EBITDA,  which I translate as earnings.   That was Berkshire Hathaway,  vice chairman Charlie Munger,  about a week and a half ago when he was speaking at the annual shareholders meeting for his other company,  The Daily Journal, answering questions, giving his usual straight answers when things come up as questions.  Warren, that was Charlie talking about EBITDA earnings,  calling them B.S.  earnings, although he said it a little more more explicitly.  You in your shareholder letter for Berkshire Hathaway also wrote about how you don't believe in gap earnings.  What how do you guys come about this?  What do you think?  You still have to report these numbers,  but you're basically telling shareholders don't listen to them.  Well,  the the yeah, it's two different principles.  I mean, the gap numbers which show us earning 80 billion,  which is more than any company's ever earned in history.  And we explain why that really isn't the relevant statistic, because a lot of that was just the stock market going up,  which now gets counted in our earnings.  And Charlie was expressing an opinion we both have.  I'm sure Charlie is the shy,  reticent one of the pair.  But Charlie is the best partner anybody could possibly have.  We've been partners now for 60 years and you could not have a better partner.  He at 96,  a woman since that meeting, actually,  in the last couple of weeks,  a woman said to him, is it true, Mr.  Munger, that you have eight children?  And Charlie's reply was so far.  So Charlie, Charlie is very much  an active partner.  We'll put it that way.  Next time I see him,  I'll get an update on that. "
323,1:30:27,1:30:27,SPEAKER 1, Does he?
324,1:30:27,1:30:28,BUFFETT," So far, so far. "
325,1:30:28,1:30:40,SPEAKER 1," OK, let us know what happens.  Yeah, I will.  You know, we watch pretty closely Charlie shareholder meeting for The Daily Journal.  Sure.  We send cameras out.  We watch it.  I've been out myself.  Do you watch that meeting,  too, to see what he has? "
326,1:30:48,1:30:48,BUFFETT,"I watched it all on YouTube after afterwards.  But my sister and one of my good friends and my niece were all there. And and no, I end up  watching it.  And I actually end up reading it usually, too. And I wouldn't miss it.  But I don't go out for it."
327,1:30:57,1:31:01,SPEAKER 1, Was there anything he said that surprised you this time around?  And I'm just looking through some of his.
328,1:31:01,1:31:03,BUFFETT," Actually, nothing Charlie says can surprise me. "
329,1:31:04,1:31:08,SPEAKER 1, Is there anything that enlightened you or changed your opinion on something?  Maybe something.
330,1:31:08,1:31:33,BUFFETT," No, but I learned from Charlie every time I talk to him.  Charlie has the best 30 second mind in the world.  So I can go to him with a new question,  a new problem of any kind.  And it goes through about eight filters in his mind in in 10 seconds.  And he gets to the essence  of any problem.  There is nobody better to talk to than Charlie at age 96. "
331,1:31:35,1:31:42,SPEAKER 1," Is there anything you've talked to him about recently that you might be able to share?  I don't know if you want to share the conversations you guys have privately,  but anything where you bounce something off of him and he.  Well, I bounce. "
332,1:31:43,1:32:11,BUFFETT," I mean, we we talk about a lot of things and we talk a lot of we talk particularly about things we don't know the answer to.  And and,  you know, we find the whole scene  so interesting, whether it's politically or economically,  the world.  I mean, it it's incredibly interesting to us.  And and we're particularly interested in each other's view,  although I think I'm more interested in his view.  He is in mine.  And that would be a correct decision to make for somebody overhearing us. "
333,1:32:11,1:32:13,SPEAKER 1, What's something you guys don't understand right now?
334,1:33:15,1:33:15,BUFFETT,"Oh, we we do not understand at all  what the outcome will be  in a world where 13 trillion is being borrowed at less than zero.  And even Greece went on short term.  And I think Greece,  the 10 year bond is one percent, for example.  And and at the same time in this country,  we're having under very good business and market conditions,  we're having a four and a half percent  federal deficit and nobody is concerned in the least.  And we're talking about massive new programs and so on.  Everybody talks about  how they'll pay for them, but they really,  you know, the deficit is going to widen.  So we don't know what world comes out of something where you start with extremely low interest rates  and high rates of growth.  And then what you do for stimulus  later on.  But the whole game,  I mean, the game always unfolds differently than you expect. And and that's what makes it so interesting."
335,1:33:18,1:33:32,SPEAKER 1," You know, the 10 year speaking of these low rates just a little bit ago hit its lowest yield since July of 2016.  This morning, I think it was one point three,  seven, seven percent.  We're back at one point three,  nine, six percent, but 10 year rates below one point four percent.  You have anticipated this.  It makes no sense to lend money at one point four percent to the U.S.  government when it's government policy to change,  to have two percent a year inflation.  I mean, you've got you've got  the government is telling you we're going to give you one point four percent and tax you on it.  And on the other hand, we're going to  presumably devalue that money at two percent a year.  So these are very unusual conditions. And classical economics, it doesn't appear that,  you know, what do people do under such circumstances?  Everybody buy a mattress and stick their money under the mattress or what?  And it particularly seems  unusual when the world is generally prosperous.  And, you know, but that's the game is always changing,  but it always looks logical in retrospect.  And it always looks puzzling and prospectively.  But there's always things to do that make sense to like what?  Well, I hope that's what we're doing.  It's buying good businesses at decent prices,  whether all of the businesses or parts of the businesses through the stock market.  You know, you told me a year and a half ago,  maybe longer, that when you went out to try and buy whole businesses right now,  it just looks too expensive.  Which is why you started buying pieces of companies,  more stocks, but places like Apple.  Is that still the case?  Is it still a huge premium to try and buy a company outright? "
336,1:34:56,1:35:45,BUFFETT," There's quite a premium.  And part of the premium is because you can borrow so much money so cheap,  so cheaply in buying those businesses.  Obviously, you can pay more for a business if you can borrow a very high percentage of  the purchase price and of the future cash flow committed to it.  And you can borrow low rates with with very little in the way of restrictions,  restrictive covenants or anything of the sort.  I mean, that's going to bring higher prices.  And the demand for that is huge.  And people look at those rates on the 30 year,  the 10 year, and they say to themselves,  gee, I can't live on that.  And so they they stretch and buy poor credits.  But that's that's just part of the human cycle over time.  And that that leads to something else.  And that leads to something else.  In the end, if you own good businesses at the right price,  you're going to do fine. "
337,1:35:45,1:35:57,SPEAKER 1," You're often quoted as saying that you don't know who's skinny dipping until the tide goes out.  Who's swimming naked?  Yeah, I'd goes out.  I remember maybe you get the sense with a high tide right now that there's a lot of skinny. "
338,1:35:57,1:36:41,BUFFETT," Well, we're certainly doing.  We're allowing people to borrow money on much weaker terms  than we were five or 10 years  ago.  You couldn't borrow money at all or for a period of 10 years ago.  I mean, you literally you could.  Berkshire couldn't borrow money.  I mean, everything stopped.  And now we've the pendulum has  swung dramatically.  And yet we still have you know,  we have very, very, very low rates.  It's hard to believe that 10 years or 20 years from now,  we will have a substantial continuation of negative interest rates.  But I've already seen things I didn't think could happen.  Who knows what could happen?  That's what makes it interesting. "
339,1:36:41,1:37:12,SPEAKER 1," Let's get back out to Omaha,  where Becky Quick is with Warren Buffett.  And there's a lot of important things happening.  But don't forget that March Madness is right around the corner,  Becky.  And you should see what he's doing right now,  Joe.  He was rubbing his hands as you said that.  Now you're talking his language.  Now.  Well, Creighton, it was 70 to 35 at one point.  And I had Creighton yesterday.  I don't know if you were paying attention to that.  Were you watching that at all?  Warren?  Nebraska plays tonight. "
340,1:37:12,1:37:17,BUFFETT, We pay attention.  We pay attention to Creighton out here.
341,1:37:18,1:37:47,SPEAKER 1," They're good.  We talked about it earlier this morning.  Off camera.  I think they're peaking.  I mean, they're getting better and better and better.  The three point shooting was I think that one guy was seven for seven at one point yesterday, which is  I'd be like seven for  ten thousand for three pointers, I think.  Anyway, get back to business.  I just I'm looking forward to it,  Warren.  And I know we always have our own personal bet.  If I get them all right,  you give me Berkshire Hathaway,  which would be cool for me. "
342,1:37:49,1:37:54,BUFFETT," I'll tell you, if you get if you get it all the way,  I'll give you my Berkshire Hathaway shares all the way to the 64. "
343,1:37:55,1:37:57,SPEAKER 1, Wow.  Wow.
344,1:37:57,1:37:58,BUFFETT, A bracket.
345,1:37:58,1:38:05,SPEAKER 1," I got a pledge against that's the ultimate giving.  Yeah,  that's how sure he is that you won't be able to do it. "
346,1:38:06,1:38:06,BUFFETT, I'm pretty sure.
347,1:38:06,1:39:07,SPEAKER 1," Andrew, I hear you.  I hear you have a question to Andrew.  I have I actually have a couple.  And I thought that I read the letter like everybody else over the weekend.  It was fascinated by so many of your comments.  Warren, specifically, I wanted to ask you,  you talk about diversity on boards in this letter.  And one of the things I wanted you to weigh in on,  if you could, is I don't know if you saw,  but David Salomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,  on our air, actually announced a couple of weeks ago that he won't be taking any companies public.  Goldman won't unless they have at least one diverse board member and are likely going to push that to two.  You know, in the state of California,  they put a law into place saying that you needed to have a female board member.  And I'm curious what you think of not just the push towards more diversity on boards, but the requirement.  Because I also note in your letter that you have very specific thoughts about what it means to be a board member,  what it means to be an independent board member, how wealth  is involved in all of that.  What are your thoughts?  Well,  at Berkshire for decades,  we've given the three factors in addition to integrity,  but for board membership.  And we want people who are business savvy.  We want them to have a  strong personal interest in Berkshire itself.  And we've got directors who really represent shareholders,  basically, at Berkshire.  And I think they do a great job.  Now, that doesn't mean that they don't think that we should delight our customers,  that we should treat associates well,  that we should behave well in our community,  both local and national.  But  our directors represent the shareholders.  So  Warren, just to just to follow up on it, though,  what's your thought about both the requirement that maybe banks and others,  investors are going to force companies to have diverse candidates on their board laws,  as I mentioned, in California?  Yeah,  I actually there there may be there's been sent to us a proposal,  which unless it's withdrawn,  will be on our proxy.  I can't tell you precisely what it says,  but the relationship issue and we will get our shareholders view on it.  But I,  I personally and I want shareholders that I want directors that represent the shareholders.  And, you know,  in terms of my estate,  you know, with with  maybe currently 80 billion dollars worth of shares to give to philanthropy,  I hope that we have  a and we do have a group of directors that I think will be very conscious of doing the right thing.  The reason I ask the question is because the other point you made,  which I think is a very smart one and is often misconstrued in the corporate governance land,  is that an independent director these days isn't always independent in large part.  And you make the point that those that don't come to the table with some form of wealth often need the job.  They need the money.  They want the money.  And therefore, that makes them less independent.  And the reason I ask this is one of the things as we've been trying to get more diverse candidates on boards,  more women on boards,  as you know, there are there are there are fewer CEOs,  fewer people who have made enormous amounts of money and people therefore they can question their independence.  It becomes a very tricky issue.  And that's what I was hoping you might weigh in on. "
348,1:41:42,1:43:47,BUFFETT," Yeah, Andrew, I've been on 21 publicly owned boards of publicly owned companies and I've seen them in operation.  And I would say that  that people that I have often seen and that's perfectly understandable.  I have often seen people who are classified as independent directors and they are getting three hundred thousand dollars a year for a job that takes them  a couple of days,  maybe six times a year,  maybe four times a year.  And the company flies into their office and it's very enjoyable and the company's good.  And and who wouldn't want a job like that?  I mean, it's an incredible job.  And people I get calls from I get calls from headhunters.  I get calls from CEOs and they ask,  you know, who I think would make a quote good and quote director.  And what they are asking is,  you know, who is not going to cause too much trouble and who is going to reflect who their name is going to reflect credit on the institution.  And they are not looking for somebody that that that I would regard as really independent.  And I don't blame them.  I mean, if if if I had spent my life being,  you know, a teacher or whatever it might be,  I mean, my IQ is just as high as the average or higher than the people on the boards.  And all that.  But on the other hand,  I want to get on a board.  I mean, three hundred thousand bucks a year would look terrific.  And you don't even have to retire.  Probably in most cases,  a sixty five or anything of the sort.  So to call them independent is ridiculous.  And if you're if you're on one board like that,  you want to really go on another one and make six hundred thousand a year.  And you are not going to do things that irritate your president,  CEO.  So when he or she gets a call and says,  would this guy make a good director,  that the answer is no.  It's it's it's just ridiculous to ignore the factor of compensation with board members. "
349,1:43:48,1:44:18,SPEAKER 1," OK,  all right, let me let me ask a follow up question that is similarly related.  Warren, and that's just having to do with sustainability,  all these issues that are out there,  guys in the control room.  Sorry, this is not where I told you I was going.  But Abhishek Bhojra wrote in a question.  He said Larry Fink recently said that our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate integrated portfolios can provide better risk adjusted return to investors.  What's your view on sustainable investing? "
350,1:44:19,1:44:53,BUFFETT," Well, I don't happen to make that decision when I'm  buying stocks in our portfolio.  I'm I what their individual policies are.  I think they're all pro social.  I mean, obviously,  you've got to be in tune with your society.  But if you if you think that I look down at a bunch of stocks and decide whether to buy Apple or whether to buy J.P.  Morgan or I am not I'm not using the the factors and and the delays out. "
351,1:44:53,1:45:28,SPEAKER 1," OK,  I want to run through a series of questions that have been in.  These are kind of all over the map.  So forgive me, we'll bounce around.  But these are questions that came in from viewers that I thought were good ones.  Lucas writes in, he said, did Justin Sun change your mind on cryptocurrency?  For anybody who doesn't know,  Justin Sun bought the dinner or the lunch that you just had from the last Glide Foundation fundraiser.  He is actively involved in Bitcoin.  After that meeting,  his PR people put out some notes saying that, you know,  you kind of listen to cryptocurrency and maybe you're a little more in tune with the idea of Bitcoin now.   Well, I would say this when Justin and four friends came,  they behaved perfectly and we had a good three and a half hour dinner.  And the whole thing was a very friendly exchange of ideas.  But cryptocurrency is basically have no value and they don't produce anything.  So you can look at your little ledger item for the next 20  years and it says you've got X of this cryptocurrency or that it doesn't reproduce.  It doesn't it doesn't deliver.  It can't mail you a check.  It can't do anything.  And what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for it later on.  But then that person's got the problem.  But in terms of value,  you know, zero.  So it sounds like he did not change your position. "
352,1:46:09,1:46:25,BUFFETT," No, but I didn't change his either.  And I had a very pleasant dinner.  And those people were,  they behaved more than well.  And they gave four point six or Justin gave four point six million to Glide.  And that will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco.  So I thank him. "
353,1:46:26,1:46:28,SPEAKER 1, He gave you some Bitcoin.  What's it feel like to be a Bitcoin?
354,1:46:28,1:46:32,BUFFETT, I don't have any Bitcoin.
355,1:46:33,1:46:39,SPEAKER 1," You don't?  No.  OK.  No, you don't own Bitcoin. "
356,1:46:39,1:46:44,BUFFETT," No, I do not own one.  I don't own any cryptocurrency.  I never will. "
357,1:46:45,1:46:45,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, in the end,  I may start a war on currency.  You know, maybe I can create one and I'll say there's only gonna be 21 million of them.  And you can have a little ledger sheet from me and everything that says you have it.  And and you're going to have it after I die.  And but you can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.  And the interesting thing,  of course, is that  Bitcoin's been out there a long time and people  talked about how it would be used and in various kinds of  exchange.  But  none of our companies are doing business in in Bitcoin or anything.  Yeah. "
358,1:47:17,1:47:27,BUFFETT," Bitcoin has been used, I think,  to move around a fair amount of money illegally.  So the the  people in countries where you.  Yeah.  So the logical move from the introduction of Bitcoin is to go short suitcases  because the money that was taken in suitcases from one country to another suitcases will probably fall off in demand.  I mean, so you can look at that as the economic contribution of Bitcoin to the society is. "
359,1:47:48,1:48:10,SPEAKER 1," All right.  Let's talk about a question that comes in from Rusty Thomas.  And he has he's got a question on baseball.  He said, given Warren's love of baseball and the contrast between his deft management of the Solomon Brothers scandal and Major League Baseball's inexplicable mismanagement of the Astros sign stealing debacle.  What advice would Warren provide MLB Commissioner Manfred to restore confidence and integrity in the game? "
360,1:48:10,1:48:28,BUFFETT," Yeah, well,  it survived the Black Sox scandal back around 1920 and people will continue to love baseball.  But, you know,  it was one thing to steal signs if you were on second base.  But it's bad.  Baseball will get past this. "
361,1:48:29,1:48:34,SPEAKER 1, You're a huge baseball fan.  Were you?  Pardon me?  You're a huge baseball fan.  Were you surprised to hear about?
362,1:48:34,1:48:35,BUFFETT," Yeah, I was surprised to hear about it. "
363,1:48:36,1:48:36,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
364,1:48:36,1:49:03,BUFFETT," But then I find out that Bobby Thompson's home.  You know,  somebody stole the sign,  I think, off Ralph Brank or somebody.  You know, so people are going to in any games,  including the stock market game,  you know, a certain number of people cheat.  And and generally we have people that administer things to try and minimize the cheating.  And and I'm sure that Major League Baseball will  will address the problem. "
365,1:49:03,1:49:05,SPEAKER 1, Should the Astros players get off scot-free?
366,1:49:05,1:49:12,BUFFETT," Oh, I'm not going to make a judgment on that.  But Joe Jackson certainly didn't. "
367,1:49:13,1:49:37,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me ask you about a question that came in from several viewers,  actually.  And that's about ETFs.  DeMosley Management wrote this version of the question.  And news agencies have reported that Berkshire Hathaway purchased two ETFs.  So can you talk about if this purchase happened and if the purchase happened,  who purchased the ETF for Berkshire Hathaway?  And how was the decision made to purchase it?  Yeah, it wasn't me.  It wasn't me or it wasn't Todd or it wasn't Ted.  And it happened in some pension fund. And we have a few pension funds that aren't actually managed by us.  But I all I can tell you is that nobody had  nobody that manages money at Berkshire is buying ETFs,  nor do I see any possibility that they will.  Another purchase that came up recently,  Kroger and Jason Escamilla writes in.  Was that one of yours or a lieutenant's pick? "
368,1:50:05,1:50:06,BUFFETT, It was one of the others.
369,1:50:08,1:50:08,SPEAKER 1," And,  you know, I know Kroger.  Kroger's done a good job,  but it's in a very tough business.  I mean, when you have  when you have Amazon and  Walmart slugging it out and Costco taking a special part of it and everything,  it's a tough business,  but they've done a good job.  And and one of our managers decided to buy that. And then Kraft Heinz.  This comes in from David Hall.  He says, Mr.  Buffett, while Kraft Heinz continues to whittle down their total debt,  do you feel that the current dividend payout is appropriate  or should it be reduced further to free up more cash flow to reduce debt more rapidly?  Now, I think Kraft Heinz should pay down its debt.  And it should."
370,1:50:48,1:51:12,BUFFETT," But I think under present circumstances,  it appears that it can pay the dividend and pay down debt at a reasonable rate.  And it has too much debt,  but it doesn't have some it doesn't have debt.  It can't pay down.  And the the debt holders are going to get the interest and the debt should come down year by year.  And I think it will.  And I think it can with the present dividend.  But who knows for sure in the future? "
371,1:51:13,1:51:18,SPEAKER 1," Theo Phelos writes in a similar question and says,  do you still believe in the company and management? "
372,1:51:18,1:51:33,BUFFETT," It's still a great business in the sense that it earns,  we'll say, five billion dollars after depreciation pre-tax on seven billion of tangible assets.  It uses about seven billion of fixed assets.  It has no working out. "
373,1:51:33,1:51:33,SPEAKER 1," I mean,  it's a very valuable business.  But we paid too much for for Kraft and we we took on more debt than that.  And but we paid too much.  Another question comes in from Beale again on Kraft Heinz.  And this person writes in private labels have performed very well against brands like Kraft Heinz,  but they haven't made a dent against other brands like Coca-Cola or C's.  Why do you think that is?  And how do you think about brands modes,  given your experience with Kraft? "
374,1:52:02,1:53:45,BUFFETT," Brands are always going to be in a fight with the retailer and.  And it varies by country enormously,  it varies by product category.  If people worked in a grocery store in 1941,  Charlie worked in state one in 1940,  people would call and they'd ask for a can of peas and I'd write down a can of peas.  They'd call it and they'd ask for  Heinz ketchup.  And I better get give them Heinz ketchup.  They didn't care which brand the peas were.  They didn't care that much whether the two quarts of milk we sent them were this brand or that brand.  But they cared whether it was it was it was Heinz ketchup.  That was 1941.  Some brands are terribly strong.  You can't bring out a a private label call and do very well with it.  And people have tried for a long,  long time.  On the other hand,  you can bring up private labels and lots of products and and they sell very well.  And, you know, you take  Costco with their own Kirkland label.  I mean, that that label grows dramatically.  It cuts across categories.  It it it, you know, it it's done since 1992 or whenever it was introduced.  Do what other people spent a hundred years,  you know, with huge amounts of advertising and special display,  all kinds of things.  So the battle goes on.  I would say that the retailer has gained ground against brands to some degree.  But brands are still terribly important.  I mean, try and give me a 10 billion dollar budget and ask me to bring out another Coca-Cola that makes a dent in Coca-Cola.  And I can't do it. "
375,1:53:45,1:54:04,SPEAKER 1," Warren, one of the questions that did come in,  it was something that you wrote about in the annual letter,  was the role that Greg and Ajit play.  Greg Abel, Ajit Jain, the two vice chairman who were recently added as vice chairman,  the role that they're going to be playing in the annual meeting with shareholders.  You said that they will play a larger role in the shareholder meeting.  How will that work? "
376,1:54:04,1:54:34,BUFFETT," Well, it will mean that any shareholder or any of the journalists there who are presenting questions from shareholders that have been sent to them can direct those questions to either Ajit or to Greg.  So if they were insurance questions,  they might want to direct them to Ajit,  not insurance questions to Greg.  But they will be there  and we'll have 60 or so questions.  We don't know what they're going to be.  And if anybody says,  I would like Greg to answer this or I would like Ajit to answer this,  then they're right there adjacent to us. "
377,1:54:34,1:54:36,SPEAKER 1, They'll be sitting on stage with you and Charlie?
378,1:54:36,1:54:42,BUFFETT," Well, there's this.  Yeah, there's there's somebody sitting in front of the crowd.  There's two different levels of tears there.  Yeah. "
379,1:54:43,1:54:52,SPEAKER 1," Again, you said you did this because you'd gotten a lot of questions from directors,  shareholders,  other people who had kind of advised you that they thought it was good for them to be playing a bigger role. "
380,1:54:52,1:55:05,BUFFETT, Everybody I heard from quite a few people now we directed questions out to them where they were sitting with the directors out in front.  Then the spotlight went down.  But this may encourage more questions directly of them.  And that'll be terrific.
381,1:55:06,1:55:17,SPEAKER 1," OK.  Jim Bean writes in a question,  he says, in the past, both you and Bill Gates have stated that half of the board meetings are spent discussing succession.  How has this changed since Ajit and Greg are on the board?  Do they leave the room? "
382,1:55:18,1:55:54,BUFFETT," They leave the room.  But  if I die tonight,  the board tomorrow morning knows exactly what they're going to do.  I hope they're polite about it,  let the body cool off.  Basically, they know what they're going to do.  And the interesting thing about it is  we own, you know, the Apple and JP Morgan,  all those things.  I don't know who's going to succeed the CEOs of  any of the companies.  I think that we own stock.  But we're well prepared for succession.  It's almost going to be embarrassing.  All right. "
383,1:55:54,1:56:07,SPEAKER 1," Let's get to a few more shareholder questions.  Chip Crook writes in a note and says it was reported that Boeing was looking for a large cash  loan.  Were you ever approached about Berkshire loaning the money,  kind of like the Goldman Sachs  deal from years ago? "
384,1:56:08,1:56:12,BUFFETT," I think I think Boeing's raised about 13 billion,  but that's bank type  money.  In other words, my memory is that it's maybe 1 percent.  They're looking for they're looking for traditional bank loans and we don't make traditional bank loans. "
385,1:56:24,1:56:44,SPEAKER 1," You also talked in the letter about how Berkshire Hathaway has Berkshire  Hathaway Energy, I should say, has the ability and the talent to manage big investments,  100 billion dollars and more.  I think you wrote,  we stand ready and willing and able on such opportunities.  California Governor Gavin Newsom asked you at one point to bid on PG&E.  Is that such an opportunity? "
386,1:56:45,1:57:09,BUFFETT," PG&E, we've obviously I mean,  we've worked with them for decades and been familiar with them.  But but  that doesn't that doesn't fit Berkshire.  But if there were 100 billion of transmission lines or whatever it might be,  Berkshire could do it.  I mean, and we would love it.  That happens to be a very tough thing to do because you cross all these states and everybody says not in my backyard and all that. "
387,1:57:09,1:57:09,SPEAKER 1," But  but there can be huge,  intelligent investment  made in the utility energy area and no one is better equipped to do it than Berkshire in both talent and resources.  Why does PG&E not fit that bill?  It's too tough.  I don't know the answer to it.  I mean, that rearranging that utility,  I think I know Governor Newsom.  I think he's a very,  very, very smart guy.  And in terms of  solving this problem, it's just not easy.  You've got so many constituencies and they're at each other's throats and there's lots of money involved. And"
388,1:57:46,1:57:50,BUFFETT, I don't want to be the guy.  I don't know how to solve all that.
389,1:57:50,1:58:14,SPEAKER 1," OK, let's go on to a question that is posed by Ken Ducey.  He says you sold 31 newspapers after buying them over 40 years as a self-described newspaper addict.  You said recently that most newspapers were toast.  I know that's not exactly that's not true.  This isn't his question.  You can answer that.  Yeah.  Do you believe the problem with local newspapers is a lack of demand or a lack of innovation and a new business model? "
390,1:58:14,1:59:31,BUFFETT," Well, the problem is that,  well, getting back to the toast comment,  Andy Shoreware actually is the fellow who said toast.  He was interviewing me and I repeated it.  But the the problem is even every day,  the circulation of the papers in every every print circulation goes down.  And the interesting thing about it,  of course, is that the three survivors so far that look promising online are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.  All three of those papers  sold their smaller papers.  The New York Times sold,  I think, 11 papers  about seven or eight years ago.  The Dow Jones, which owned The Wall Street Journal and now is owned by News Corp,  they sold the Ottawa newspapers, eight papers.  Washington Post sold the Epoch Tarot.  So they all saw the handwriting on the wall before I did.  And they all sold their papers.  That was their reaction.  They did not they did not try and figure out the online solutions.  They got out of them.  And unfortunately, I bought some and we're still in.  I mean, we are financing Lee and we think Lee has by far the best opportunity  to continue print as long as anybody and to find an online solution for these papers.  So we put new money into the newspaper industry here or we've committed to do it. "
391,1:59:31,1:59:44,SPEAKER 1," It will close in a month or two.  And then finally, very quickly, we are in the Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters  building here in Omaha.  Strom writes in a question,  says, why did you decide to rent your offices for all these  years instead of buying the building or building your own office building? "
392,1:59:44,1:59:54,BUFFETT," Well, we only use one floor of the 15 floors here,  but we have signed a lease for the  next 20 years on one more floor.  So it shows just how flexible our thinking is about the future. "
393,1:59:54,1:59:56,SPEAKER 1, How much growth you're anticipating?
394,1:59:56,2:00:04,BUFFETT," Yeah, we don't want a big headquarters office.  If we had a big headquarters office,  we'd fill it.  Believe me, I mean, if we had 15 floors of our own,  we'd have 15 floors worth of people. "
395,2:00:06,2:00:22,SPEAKER 1," Warren, before we let you go,  let's just go back to the futures again this morning,  because right now the Dow is indicated to open down about 100 or 830 points.  Weakness again on concerns about coronavirus and what that means.  What's your mentality today as you kind of go out and look at the stock market and decide what you're going to do? "
396,2:00:23,2:00:33,BUFFETT, We're buying businesses to own for 20 or 30 years.  We buy them in whole.  We buy them in part.  They're called stocks when we buy them in part.  And we think the 20 and 30 year outlook has not changed by coronavirus.
397,2:00:34,2:00:40,SPEAKER 1," All right,  Warren, I want to thank you for your time today.  We really appreciate it.  Your generosity with your time.  And we hope to see you again soon. "
398,2:00:41,2:00:42,BUFFETT, Come every year.
399,2:00:42,2:00:42,SPEAKER 1, Thank you.
400,0:00:00,0:00:05,BUFFETT, various degrees in the last six months or so at various times.
401,0:00:06,0:00:12,BUFFETT," The businesses have left the incredible period,  which is about as extraordinary as I've seen in business since World War II,  where the government would port out a lot of money to people who couldn't get goods."
402,0:00:23,0:00:25,SPEAKER 3," It was more extreme in World War II,  but this was extreme this time. And it was just a question of getting goods to deliver, and people bought, and they didn't wait for sales. And if you couldn't sell them one thing, they would put another thing in the backlog.  It was an extraordinary period,  and that period has ended."
403,0:00:45,0:00:46,BUFFETT," It hasn't ended with,  as you know, it isn't that employment's fallen off a cliff or anything in the least,  but it is a different climate than it was six months ago.  And a number of our managers were surprised.  Some of them had too much inventory on order, and then all of a sudden it got delivered, and people weren't in the same frame of mind as earlier.  And now we'll start having sales at places where we didn't need to have sales before.  But despite the fact  that this year, I think in general,  will be slower than last year,  we actually are situated so that I would expect, and believe me when I say expect,  it's nothing is sure, nothing's sure tomorrow,  nothing's sure next year, and nothing is ever sure, either in markets or in business forecasts or anything else. And we don't pay much attention to markets or forecasts unless the markets  happen to offer something interesting to do."
404,0:01:55,0:01:55,SPEAKER 1," But  nevertheless, we are positioned in two respects, as you'll see from this first report.  Our investment income is going to be a lot larger this year than last year,  and that's built in.  I  mean,  we had, as you'll see in a minute,  we've had $125 billion or so in very short-term investments,  and believe it or not, not that long ago,  we were getting four basis points,  which is next to nothing, on that $125 billion, which means we were getting $50 million a year,  and now the same money the other,  just day or day before yesterday, we actually bought, because of some funny twist in the market because of doubts about the deficit ceiling,  or the debt ceiling,  we bought $3 billion of bills at a 590,  that's 5.9,  5.92,  bond equivalent yield.  So we will have  what produced us not that long ago on a 12-month basis was producing $50 million a year,  producing something in the area of $5 billion a year."
405,0:03:19,0:03:26,SPEAKER 3," So we're in a position where the investment income is essentially,  well, it is certain to increase quite a bit.  And insurance underwriting is not,  it does not correlate with business activity.  It depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes and  other events.  So on a perspective basis, on a probability basis, we're likely to have a better year this year in insurance underwriting than we had last year.  It just isn't affected by what you might call the business cycle,  or what applies to generally an industry,  pee-tailing, you name it.  So I would expect,  in one massive earthquake or one hurricane that came in at just the wrong place,  can affect that prediction."
406,0:04:27,0:04:31,SPEAKER 1," But on a probabilistic basis,  our insurance looks better this year. "
407,0:04:32,0:04:38,BUFFETT," So if you get two of the elements there of our earnings that  look like they will swing in our direction, I would expect, but I can't promise that our operating earnings will be greater than last year.  And if we'll move to the second slide,  I give you those operating earnings figures just to give you  an overview of what has happened since the pandemic started and often the year before as a base.  And we retain all our earnings, as you know.  So if we're retaining $30 or $35 billion or whatever it may be a year, you should expect more operating earnings over time.  I mean,  this number should be significantly higher five or ten or 15 years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings. And that's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started. And they got there by retaining earnings and will keep retaining earnings.  So it's no great triumph if these numbers move up.  And what we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate."
408,0:05:51,0:05:52,SPEAKER 1," Historically,  they moved up at an unreasonable rate sometimes, but we were working with much smaller sums then. And that can't be repeated with our present capital base."
409,0:06:01,0:06:04,BUFFETT," Because I note there,  I believe it's on this slide. "
410,0:06:04,0:06:05,SPEAKER 3," Let's take a look.   Now that'll be,  let's see, it's on the next page.  Let's move to the next slide.  We show that we had on March 31st,  now $504 billion.  Of gap net worth.  Now what might surprise you is that there's no other company in the United States,  no other company that has a number that is that large."
411,0:06:44,0:06:45,BUFFETT," Now,  that isn't because we've got the most valuable company in the United States.  Other companies have used their money to repurchase shares.  They could have accumulated $504 billion in gap.  But basically we have more  under gap accounting now than any other company in the US.  And of course, if you measure return on equity,  that becomes a very big number to increase at a rapid rate, but we hope to do so.  Not a rapid rate,  a decent rate. And right below that,  you see something called float.  And float is money that  is left in our hands somewhat akin,  but very importantly different than a bank deposit.  But you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit,  you have to pay more interest these days, and you have to run a bank and do a lot of things.  And basically,  this is money that represents unpaid losses at this time."
412,0:08:01,0:08:03,SPEAKER 1," You get paid in advance in insurance.   So what shows up as a net liability on our balance sheet  is gives us funds to exercise with an amount of discretion that no other insurance company that I know of in the world enjoys,  just because we have so much net worth.  And our float now comes to $165 billion.  And the man sitting on the far left is responsible for moving that number up from a pittance in 1986 to this incredible figure,  which in most years,  practically all years, hasn't cost us anything. So it's like  having a bank with no employees,  no interest,  and no ability to withdraw the money in a hurry that we have working for us.  And it's a very valuable asset that  shows up as a liability. And"
413,0:09:08,0:09:35,BUFFETT," Ajit  is responsible for building up this treasure,  which has been done by  out-competing insurance companies all over the world.  And now a number of our insurance companies,  in turn, are run by talented managers who contributed one way or another.  Start with Geico,  the beginning of my career. And that float, if you think about it,  just think of a balance sheet.  You've got liabilities here,  and you've got assets over here. And the liability side finances the asset side."
414,0:09:51,0:09:52,SPEAKER 1," It's very simple.  And stockholders' equity finances it,  long-term debt finances it, and so on.  But stockholders' equity is very expensive in a real sense."
415,0:10:03,0:10:05,SPEAKER 3," Long-term debt has been cheap for a while,  but it can get expensive, and it can also become due eventually,  and it may not be available.  But float  is another item that shows it's a liability, but hasn't cost us anything. And it can't disappear in a hurry.  And it  finances the asset side in the same way as stockholders' equity.  And nobody else thinks of it much that way, but we've always thought of it that way, and it's built up over time."
416,0:10:36,0:10:43,SPEAKER 2," So I show at the bottom what's happened with cash and Treasury bills through March 31st.  And I will tell you that in the month of April, we probably added about $7 billion to that factor.  Now, part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock,  because that reduces cash and Treasury bills.  We bought about $400 million worth of stock in the month of April.  That's a minus in terms of cash available.  And we, however, sold some stock which produced maybe $4 billion. And of course, we had operating earnings, probably $2.5 billion or something in that area. And my guess is we probably increased our cash and Treasury bills $6 and $7 billion in the month.  And I just want to give you a feel for how the cash flows at Berkshire. And then if we move to the final, I think it's the final one,  next to the last one."
417,0:11:47,0:11:49,BUFFETT," No, I think it is the last one. "
418,0:11:49,0:11:50,SPEAKER 3," Let's see, is it the fourth? "
419,0:11:51,0:11:52,BUFFETT," Yeah.  We  should have the one up there, Class A equivalent shares outstanding. And you'll notice that every year, the number of our shares go down.  So if we own more businesses and the businesses make more money, your share as shareholders, as owners of Berkshire, increases every year without you laying out any money.  Now, you're laying out the alternative which you could receive in dividends.  But the reason we've  gotten to where we are is because we kept the money.  We did pay a dividend in 1967,  10 cents to share.  It was a terrible mistake.  And I always tell people that I'd left for  the men's room and the directors voted while I was gone.  But that isn't true.  I was there, I confess.  But we reinvested and that's produced the $500 billion plus of shareholders' equity and the $30 billion plus of operating earnings.  And we'll continue to follow that policy because it makes a great deal of sense.  And with that,  I think we've taken care of the preliminaries. "
420,0:13:08,0:13:09,SPEAKER 6," You can study that  the 10Q is on the web page.  And if you have a week or two vacation, you could spend it reading the 10Q."
421,0:13:23,0:13:25,SPEAKER 5," But that is the essence of Berkshire.  And with that, I will start with Becky Quick. And we will alternate between Becky and the audience.  And her questions have come in from all over the country.  And I believe you identified the center. And go to it, Becky."
422,0:13:42,0:13:55,SPEAKER 6," Thanks, Warren.  The first question comes in from Randy Jeffs in Irvine, California.  And his question is,  if Silicon Valley Banks deposit had not been fully covered,  what do you think the economic consequences would have been to the nation? "
423,0:13:55,0:13:58,SPEAKER 1," Well,  I would just simply say it would have been catastrophic. And that's why they were covered. And even though the FDIC limit is $250,000, that's the way the statute reads.  But that is not the way the U.S. is going to behave any more than they're going to let the debt ceiling cause the world to go into turmoil. And they,  well, I can't imagine anybody in the administration, in the Congress, in the Federal Reserve,  whatever it may have been, FDIC, I can't imagine anybody saying, I'd like to be the one on television tomorrow and explain to the American public why we're keeping only $250 ,000 insured. And we're going to start a run on every bank in the country and disrupt the world financial system."
424,0:14:59,0:15:02,BUFFETT, So I think it was inevitable.
425,0:15:03,0:15:03,SPEAKER 1," Charlie, do you have any? "
426,0:15:06,0:15:08,SPEAKER 3," No, I have nothing to add.   Okay.  Well,  incidentally, I should mention this now."
427,0:15:14,0:15:14,BUFFETT," Ajit  and Greg will be here in the morning session, which ends at noon. And so if you've got questions to direct to them, the time to do it is in the first half of the show. And then after lunch, Charlie and I will be back."
428,0:15:31,0:15:32,SPEAKER 1, Okay.
429,0:15:33,0:15:34,SPEAKER 3, Area one.
430,0:15:36,0:15:57,SPEAKER 1," Hi.  Nirav Patel, Hayrill, Massachusetts.  Mr.  Buffett,  Mr.  Munger,  it seems like you've found the sweet spot between being too conservative and too aggressive as investors.  Do you ever make bad investment decisions because of your emotions?  And what do you do to try to keep that from happening? "
431,0:16:01,0:16:02,SPEAKER 2," Well, we make  bad investment decisions."
432,0:16:05,0:16:07,BUFFETT, Plenty of times.
433,0:16:08,0:16:11,SPEAKER 1," I make more than Charlie because I like to think it's because I make more decisions,  but probably more bad."
434,0:16:13,0:16:13,SPEAKER 6, I think average is worse.
435,0:16:15,0:16:28,BUFFETT, But I can't recall any time in the history of Berkshire that we made an emotional decision.
436,0:16:28,0:16:33,SPEAKER 1," I know the movie had Jamie Lee in there,  but that was for laughs. "
437,0:16:34,0:16:37,BUFFETT," Jamie Lee,  she's good, but she's not good enough to get me or Charlie to make an emotional decision.  Charlie,  I'm sure you have something to add on that."
438,0:16:53,0:17:02,SPEAKER 7," Well, it's a different movie than is shown at most corporate meetings. "
439,0:17:02,0:17:23,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  But  have we ever made an emotional decision?  No.  That's in business we're talking about.  Yeah.  No, you don't want to be a no emotion person in all of your life,  but you definitely want to be a no emotion person in making an investment or business decision. "
440,0:17:23,0:17:36,SPEAKER 6," But you can argue that.  We probably I would say that we've  made an emotional decision, perhaps. And when a manager has been with us for some period and we haven't, we've ignored the fact that perhaps they weren't quite what they were earlier."
441,0:17:56,0:18:00,SPEAKER 1, But  our businesses are so good that they've run better sometimes.
442,0:18:02,0:18:15,BUFFETT," I've talked about  Westco, for example, the wonderful Louisville Incentive, and it ran on automatic pilot for a while,  but I don't think we suffered by it. "
443,0:18:15,0:18:16,SPEAKER 3," But  you can argue that if Charlie and I hadn't liked  Louis as much as we did,  we might have spotted it a little bit early, but I don't think it made any difference in the results."
444,0:18:25,0:18:26,BUFFETT," Would you agree with that, Charlie? "
445,0:18:28,0:18:38,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, I agree totally with it.  And I'm glad we behaved the way we did at Westco.  By the way,  we  bought the thing for a few tens of millions and it became worth two or three billion.  Yeah, that wasn't common in the savings and loan business,  as you may have noticed."
446,0:18:50,0:18:55,BUFFETT, They really went crazy in that industry.  And we had a wonderful guy in Louis.
447,0:18:57,0:18:59,SPEAKER 7, We didn't go crazy.
448,0:18:59,0:19:00,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, we didn't go crazy. "
449,0:19:00,0:19:05,SPEAKER 1," OK,  Becky. "
450,0:19:06,0:19:46,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Ben Noll in Minneapolis.  He says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades and he's attended many Berkshire meetings.  He's here again this year.  And this is addressed to Ajit and Greg.  He says last year I asked you about how GEICO and BNSF appeared to lose ground to their leading competitors,  GEICO on telematics and BNSF on precision scheduled railroading.  Ajit, you responded by saying how you expected GEICO to make progress in a year or two.  Greg, you spoke about your pride in BNSF,  but you didn't directly address the threat of precision scheduled railroading.  Will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges and our company's strategies to address them? "
451,0:19:46,0:20:19,SPEAKER 10," In  terms of GEICO and telematics,  let me make the observation that GEICO has certainly taken the bull by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap in terms of telematics and its competitors.  They have now reached a point where on all new business,  close to 90% has a telematics  input to the pricing decision. "
452,0:20:20,0:20:21,SPEAKER 1," Unfortunately,  less than half of that is being taken up by the policyholders.  The other point I want to make is even though we have made improvements  in terms of bridging the gap on telematics,  we still haven't started to realize the true benefit  and the real culprit or the bottleneck is technology.  GEICO's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did.  It has more than 500,  actually more than 600 legacy systems that don't really talk to each other  and we are trying to compress them to no more than 15,  16 systems that all talk to each other.  That's a monumental challenge and because  of that, even though we have made improvements in telematics,  we still have a long way to go  because of technology.  Because of that and because of the whole issue more  broadly in terms of matching rate to risk,  GEICO is still a work in progress.  I don't know if any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results,  but GEICO has had  a very good first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change,  which means a margin  of six and change.  Even though that's very good,  it's not something we can take to the bank  because there are two unusual items that contributed to it.  Firstly,  we've had what is called prior year reserve releases.  We've reduced reserves for the previous years and  that contributed to it.  And secondly, every year, the first quarter tends to be a seasonally  good quarter for auto insurance  writers.  So if you adjust those two factors,  my guess is the end of the year,  GEICO will end up  with a combined ratio just south of 100 as opposed to the target they're shooting for is 96.  I hope they reach the target of 96 by the end of next year, but instead of getting too excited about it,  I think it's important to realize that even if we reach 96,  it will come at the expense of having lost policy holders.  There is a tradeoff between profitability and growth and clearly,  we're going to emphasize  profitability and not growth and that will come at the expense of policy holders.  So it will not be until two years from now that we'll be back on track  fighting the battles on both the profitability and growth front.  Garden?  Yep.   Moving to BNSF.  I'll start again by expressing great pride in the BNSF team.  We have an exceptional group of led by Katie and her managers that show up every day to do great work on the railroad.  At the same time,  they would be the first to acknowledge there's more to be done there.  The specific reference to precision scheduled railroading.  The other large railroad,  Class A railroads in the U.S.  follow that and including the two in Canada.  We're well aware of what they're doing and obviously pay close attention to their operating metrics.  Our team strives every day to be more efficient, obviously.  I would say we balance it with the needs of our customers.  If I look back to pre-2022,  so we look at the three-year period of 2019,  2020,  2021,  the BNSF team made significant progress on their efficiencies and delivering overall value back to the shareholders and to their customers.  And at the same time,  maintaining a very safe railroad for our employees.  So we're making excellent progress.  That didn't stop last year.  They made great progress again.  The reality in 2022 is we did go through a period of time where we had to  call it reset the railroad.  We came out of the pandemic.  There were the supply challenges.  We had certain other labor issues and other things going on at the port.  And the reality is our team prioritized getting the railroad back in place for the long term,  not a short-term focus on hitting certain operating metrics.  And in 2022, we're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics.  But the real focus was to get the railroad reset in a safe manner such that we could deliver long-term value and long-term service  to our customers.  And that's really what we'll continue to see with that team.  There'll be continual progress.  There'll be years where it's not as quickly or even we go backwards.  But over the long term,  we'll see exceptional results from that team and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset.  Thank you.  I would  just –  well, he deserves – both of them deserve applause.  I would like to add one thing.  The –  at GEICO, Todd Combs was the chief choice, my choice,  go back to GEICO to work on the problem of matching rate to risk, which is what insurance is all about.  And he arrived with exquisite timing right before the pandemic broke out and all kinds of things changed.  But "
453,0:25:52,0:26:03,BUFFETT," Todd is doing a wonderful job at GEICO,  and he works closely with the GEEP because he  still has a home in Omaha.  He comes back here and we get together on the weekend sometimes too.   So that's been a remarkable accomplishment under difficult circumstances.  And he's not all the way home, but he's made a very, very big change in multiple ways at GEICO.  And then one other thing I would like to mention, there have been a lot of public companies created in the last decade or thereabouts in insurance. And there's none of them that we would like to own, and they always started out in their perspective saying this is a tech company,  not an insurance company."
454,0:26:51,0:26:53,SPEAKER 5," Of course, we're – of course they're a tech company.   Everybody's – whether they're in insurance or a lot of other places – are using the facility,  but you still have to properly match rate to risk. And they invariably have reported the huge losses."
455,0:27:10,0:27:11,SPEAKER 3, They've eaten up capital.
456,0:27:12,0:27:14,SPEAKER 5, But there's been one company that nobody  has generally heard of.
457,0:27:16,0:27:17,BUFFETT," There's only been one that I know of,  a company started in the last 10 years that has been an overwhelming success, and that's a company that Ajeet and four  people who joined with him set to develop a new business."
458,0:27:33,0:27:35,SPEAKER 1, It's called Berkshire Hathaway Specialty.
459,0:27:36,0:27:40,BUFFETT," It now has – what's the float,  Ajeet?"
460,0:27:42,0:27:49,SPEAKER 1, Coming up to $12 billion.  Yeah.  We've built more float than probably all these companies combined.
461,0:27:50,0:27:52,BUFFETT," We've now –  it's cost us essentially nothing in terms of an underwriting loss.  The four people have turned  in, I don't know, $1,500 around the world.  We took on the whole industry, and we brought some unique talent, and the four people that came and now have, like I said, 1,500 or so worldwide.  And we brought capital, and we brought capabilities that really only Berkshire could supply.  So it was the combination of  brains and talent and energy and money.  And  no one has really successfully entered this space, only people in this space,  who didn't like us coming. And we did it without it."
462,0:28:46,0:28:54,SPEAKER 1," It's costing us a dime of entry,  and it's been unmatched by any of the companies that went public.  And people have seen us do it, but they can't duplicate it.  And that's what Ajeet has created. And Peter Eastwood has led this group, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty.  And it's just remarkable.  So anyway, with that,  let's go on.  Give him a hand for that.  OK, let's go to section two. "
463,0:29:29,0:29:34,SPEAKER 2," Hi, Charlie.  I'm Elwarren.  I'm Karen here from Singapore. "
464,0:29:34,0:29:40,SPEAKER 1, I'm glad you got that in.  Your priorities are right.
465,0:29:40,0:30:07,SPEAKER 2," Yes, I have a question on AI and robotics.  Here's my question.  As AI and robotics continue to advance,  what do you believe will be the positive and the negative impact  of this technology on both the stocks market and society as a whole?  And are there any specific industrials and companies  that you believe will be most impacted? "
466,0:30:12,0:30:25,SPEAKER 1," Karen, I thank you for asking Charlie that question.  Well,  if you went into BYD's factories in China,  you would see robotics going in at an unbelievable rate.  So we're going to see a lot more robotics in the world.  I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence.  I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well."
467,0:30:53,0:31:05,SPEAKER 5, There won't be anything in AI that replaces Ajeet.
468,0:31:06,0:31:07,SPEAKER 3," I'll  state that unqualifiedly.  It can do amazing things.  Bill Gates brought me out the latest,  maybe not the latest version, but one he thought maybe I could handle,  which has to be careful with me in terms of leading me too fast.  And it did these remarkable things."
469,0:31:33,0:31:36,BUFFETT," It didn't, but it couldn't tell jokes.   Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me.  And it just isn't there."
470,0:31:42,0:31:49,SPEAKER 3," But,  you know, things like  checking all the legal opinions, you know,  since the beginning of time and everything,  and eliminating all the side..."
471,0:31:52,0:32:07,SPEAKER 5," I mean, it can do all kinds of things.  And when something can do all kinds of things,  I get a little bit worried.  And because I know we won't be able to uninvent it.  And, you know,  we did invent for very, very good reason, the atom bomb  in World War II.  And it was,  you know, it was enormously important that we did so."
472,0:32:23,0:32:27,SPEAKER 1, But  is it good for the next 200 years of the world that  the ability to do so has been unleashed?  We didn't have any choice.
473,0:32:33,0:32:38,BUFFETT," But when  you start something...   Well, Einstein said after the atom bomb,  he said, this is change everything in the world except how men think.  And I would say the same thing may..."
474,0:32:50,0:32:51,SPEAKER 3," Not the same thing,  I don't mean that, but I mean, with AI, it can change everything in the world except how men think and behave.  And that's a big step to take."
475,0:33:07,0:33:09,SPEAKER 1, It's a good question.  And it's the best answer we can give.  Becky?
476,0:33:13,0:33:47,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Tom Seymour.  He says the first sentence of a recent Financial Times article read,  Charlie Munger has warned of a brewing storm in the U.S.  commercial property market with American banks full of what he said were bad loans as property prices fall.  Please elaborate on what's going on in commercial real estate.  How bad will the losses be and what sectors or geographies look particularly bad?  I'll just add an addendum from another viewer who wrote in and wanted to know if Berkshire would be more active in commercial real estate as a result. "
477,0:33:47,0:33:57,SPEAKER 7," Well, Berkshire's never been very active in commercial real estate. "
478,0:33:58,0:33:58,SPEAKER 1," It  works better for taxable investors than it does for  corporations taxed the way Berkshire is.  So I don't anticipate huge  effects on Berkshire.  But I do think that the hollowing out of the downtowns  in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant.  I think the country will get through it all right.  But as they say,  it will often involve a different set of owners. And the buildings don't go away."
479,0:34:34,0:34:35,SPEAKER 7, The owners do.
480,0:34:36,0:34:52,SPEAKER 1," Well,  but most people like to buy with non-recourse in real estate.  And one time I asked Charlie,  there was some real estate guy we were talking to,  and how do they decide how much a building like this is worth?  And the answer is, it's whatever they can borrow without signing their name. And if you look at real estate generally, you'll understand what the phenomenon that's happening if you remind yourself that that's  the attitude of most people that have become big in the real estate business. And it does mean that the lenders are the ones that get the property.  And of course, they don't want the property usually.  So then the real estate operator comes on negotiating with them and  the banks tend to  extend and pretend. And there's all kinds of activities that arrive out of commercial real estate development, which occurs on a big scale.  But it all has consequences.  And I think we're about, well, we are starting to see the consequences of people who could borrow at  2.5% and  find out it doesn't work at current rates.  And they hand it back to somebody that gave them all the money they needed to build it.  Charlie's had more experience in real estate.  Charlie got it started in real estate,  though. "
481,0:36:10,0:36:12,SPEAKER 3," I mean, Charlie.  Yes,  it's difficult.  I like what we do better."
482,0:36:21,0:36:34,SPEAKER 1," Well,  Charlie once said to me when I was leaving his house a  few months ago, I was visiting him.  We talked for a couple of hours.  And I said to Charlie as I left, I just  wasn't anybody else in the house, except  one daughter. And I said, Charlie, I'll just keep  doing what we've been doing. And Charlie said,  without looking up or pausing a second,  he said, that's all you know how to do, Warren.  Yeah.  He was right, too.  Station three, is it?  Hi, my name is Dallas Z.  I'm from Santa Clara,  California.  And my question is to Charlie and Warren.  Given the rise of disruptive technologies that can improve productivity significantly,  and AI being one of them,  how do you envision the future of value investing in this new era?  And what adaptations or new principles do you think investors should adopt?  And any recommendations for investors to remain successful in this rapid changing landscape?  Thank you."
483,0:37:36,0:37:54,SPEAKER 5," Well, I'm glad to take that one.  I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so  many of them competing for  a diminished bunch of opportunities.  So my advice to value investors is to get used to making less.  And Charlie has been telling me the same thing the whole time we've known each other.  We get along wonderfully because we are making less.  Yeah, well, but that's because that mostly I think is because it's larger.  We never thought we could manage 508 billion.  No.  Or one or five.  But I would argue that there's going to be plenty of opportunities. And part of the reason there are going to be plenty of opportunities, the tech doesn't make any difference or any of that.  I mean, if you look at how the world's changed in the years  since 1942 when I started, you'd say, well,  how does a kid that doesn't know anything about airplanes,  that doesn't know anything about engines and cars, and doesn't know anything about electricity and all that."
484,0:38:48,0:38:48,BUFFETT," But  that really isn't the,  that's not the, the world changing doesn't,  or new things coming along don't take away the opportunities.  What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. And I would say that while the 58 years we've been running Berkshire,  I would say there's been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things and they do big dumb things.  And the reason they do it to some extent is because they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started.  So you could start  10 or 15 dumb insurance companies in the last 10 years and you could become rich."
485,0:39:39,0:39:41,SPEAKER 1," If you were a droid at it,  whether the business succeeded or not,  and the underwriters got paid and the lawyers got paid. And that creates, if that's done on a large scale, which it couldn't be done, what, 58 years ago, you couldn't get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do, fortunately. And so I think that investing has disappeared so  much from this huge capitalistic market that anybody can play in,  but that the big money is in selling other people ideas.  It isn't outperforming,  in outperforming.  And I think that, I think if you don't run too much money, which we do, but if you're running small amounts of money, I think, I think the opportunities will be greater.  But then Charlie and I were always different on this subject.   He likes to tell me how gloomy the world is.  And I like to tell him, we'll find something.  And so far, we've both been kind of right."
486,0:40:52,0:40:53,SPEAKER 3," Charlie, would you  budge an inch on that or not?"
487,0:41:20,0:41:20,SPEAKER 1,"There is so much money now in the hands of  so many smart people,  all trying to outsmart one another and outpromote one another,  getting more money out of other people.  And it's a  radically different world from the world we started in. And"
488,0:41:21,0:41:27,SPEAKER 7," I suppose it will have its opportunities, but  it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes. "
489,0:41:27,0:41:32,SPEAKER 1," But they're trying to outsmart each other in arenas  that you don't have to play.  I mean,  if you look at that government bond market, the Treasury bill market, I mean, you've got this one bill that's out of line with the others.  We went over $3 billion of it the other day.  And,  but those are people, the world is overwhelmingly short term focused. And if you go to an investor relations call,  they're all trying to figure out  how to fill out a sheet to show the earnings for the year.  And the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten."
490,0:42:07,0:42:16,BUFFETT," I mean,  that  is a world that's made to order for  anybody that's trying to think about what you do that should work over five or 10 or 20 years.  And I just think that I would love to be born today and go out with not too much money and hopefully turn it into a lot of money."
491,0:42:29,0:42:29,SPEAKER 1," But,  and Charlie would too, actually, just like he would  find something to do, I will just guarantee you.  And it wouldn't be exactly the same as before, but he would have a big,  big, big pile."
492,0:42:44,0:42:54,SPEAKER 7, I would not like the thrill of losing my big pile into a small pile.  I like my big pile just the way it is.
493,0:42:54,0:42:59,SPEAKER 1," Well, I like,  we agree on that incidentally.  Yes, we do. "
494,0:43:00,0:43:03,SPEAKER 7, You're one of the most extreme lovers of the big pile.
495,0:43:03,0:43:05,SPEAKER 1, Becky.
496,0:43:07,0:43:32,SPEAKER 6," This question is for both Warren and Ajit.  It comes from Jason Planer in Livingston, New Jersey.  He says in 2016,  you entered into a very unique transaction with AIG,  where you assumed up to $20 billion of liabilities in exchange for about $10 billion up front.  Can you please provide us with an update on this transaction in light of the increase in interest rates?  And then in Tokyo,  just a few weeks ago,  you said that you were going to do a little bit of a research on the stock market."
497,0:43:33,0:43:33,SPEAKER 2," A few weeks ago,  you talked about the risks of banks with assets that were susceptible to rising interest rates.  Any insight as to how Berkshire liabilities are susceptible to duration would be appreciated."
498,0:43:44,0:43:46,SPEAKER 1, Is that directed to Ajit or me or what?  Both.
499,0:43:47,0:43:49,SPEAKER 5," Okay, let me introduce one thing, and well,  but Ajit is the key to this.  He's the one that put the deal together. "
500,0:43:53,0:43:55,SPEAKER 1," But we got handed $10 billion,  we'll say. "
501,0:43:56,0:44:04,SPEAKER 2, But we weren't restricted to putting that into bonds.
502,0:44:05,0:44:11,BUFFETT," So what the exact  interest rates affect us to some degree,  maybe, in terms of the deal we did with AIG or  anybody we would do a similar deal with like that.  But we don't have to put it in matching bonds or anything of the sort.  It goes into a general pool of assets, which we manage, and the assets, well, the liquid assets now are $130 billion plus."
503,0:44:34,0:44:35,SPEAKER 3," But it goes in,  so it is not set aside in some little compartment like people like to think."
504,0:44:42,0:45:00,SPEAKER 1," Now,  no other insurance company could do it,  but  they can't think that way.  They aren't even used to thinking that way,  but they can't think that way because they don't have our balance sheet.  We account for 26% or something like that of the net worth of all property casualty companies in the United States.   So,  so far, the payment that we have had to make have run modestly, and Ajit will correct me on this if I'm wrong, because he paid a lot of attention."
505,0:45:16,0:45:27,SPEAKER 2, The amount we have had to pay has run slightly below the amount we anticipated having to pay in terms of our share of the losses.
506,0:45:28,0:45:31,SPEAKER 1, But  it served AIG's purposes.
507,0:45:33,0:45:34,BUFFETT," It came to us with,  we're in a unique position.  There's nobody else that was  able to write that,  just like when we took on the Lloyds."
508,0:45:44,0:45:49,SPEAKER 1," I mean, Lloyds said there was no choice other than Berkshire Hathaway when they  essentially resuscitated their market by laying off a lot of liabilities on Berkshire Hathaway.  So we won't see those deals very often.  If they're for $500 million or something like that, somebody else will go in there and offer more money, and everybody's looking for money in Wall Street.  But  if they start talking with a deal like the AIG deal, there isn't any other stop.  Now,  correct me on all my numbers there, Ajit."
509,0:46:23,0:47:47,SPEAKER 10," No, one way to look at how the deal is  performing since we did the deal is,  at the point in  time when we did the deal,  we had made certain projections of  how much we will pay out each year.  And what we do is monitor what the actual payments are since the inception of  the deal, and how does that compare with what we expected to pay out.  As Warren mentioned,  these two numbers are very close to each other.  More specifically,  the actual payouts are  96% of what we had projected to pay out at this point in time,  which is good but not great.  We are still ahead of the curve.  If we do end up paying out less than what we projected,  not only would we have borrowed money at a very attractive rate,  meaning less than 4%, significantly less than 4%,  in addition to that,  we would have made a fee,  which in 2015 dollars would be a million dollars.  So we would have borrowed money at less than  4%, and we would have made a million dollar fee,  which is  slightly more than what we were expecting to do.  So net-net,  we are very happy with the deal.  We are happy we did it,  but the game is not over.  There are total liabilities that are coming down the pike every second day.  So I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will work out  better than what we expected it to work out. "
510,0:47:47,0:48:04,SPEAKER 5," Well, the really interesting thing is that  within Berkshire, the casualty insurance companies have four times as much stockholder capital  behind each dollar of premium volume.  Four times  normal. And of course we see the big deals.  Who would you trust if you had a big liability you wanted to dump on somebody? And we have $25 billion or more coming in from things other than insurance, uncorrelated to insurance, every year with no obligations."
511,0:48:29,0:48:30,SPEAKER 3," We don't pay dividends.   If you paid dividends and  you cut your dividend,  try going around trying to write insurance the next day.  I mean, it's a business where the people are counting on you to pay.  And when we take that $10 billion, we don't agree to put it in five-year bonds and 10-year bonds."
512,0:48:48,0:48:49,SPEAKER 5, We don't even think that way.  And the people that do business with us know that they have somebody like nobody else on those
513,0:48:57,0:48:59,SPEAKER 1," – that's going to be able to pay $10 billion,  you know, no matter what happens to the economy.  So it's not only the presence of enormous strength in the insurance companies,  it's the fact we've got all these earnings that essentially come in every month. And we don't have a lot of debt."
514,0:49:14,0:49:18,BUFFETT," I mean, we have debt at the railroad and the energy level. "
515,0:49:18,0:49:18,SPEAKER 5," But  in terms of the rest of the operation – and we don't guarantee that debt, but it's plenty good. And it's – there just isn't another Berkshire. And Ajit recognizes that when he's negotiating.  So does the other party, if the sums are big enough.  There's all kinds of people that love to get $500 million or $300 million, and they can – they may think in terms of lending it out because that's what their insurance companies can do at a somewhat higher rate."
516,0:49:51,0:49:53,BUFFETT," But that is not a game we play in,  and we don't have any interest in playing in it."
517,0:49:56,0:52:04,SPEAKER 1," Okay.  Station four.  Hello.  I'm Marvin Blum, an estate planning lawyer from Fort Worth, Texas,  home to many of your companies.  In fact, Warren,  I met you at the memorial for our beloved Paul Andrews,  who was manager of TTI.  I'd like to get your thoughts on a widespread problem in the world of estate planning,  and that's the failure of most parents to prepare the next generation for the inheritance coming their way.  In particular,  if the estate includes a family business,  most parents fail to do  business succession planning to plan for who will run the business on the day when,  not if,  the founder is no longer there to run it.  The kids aren't prepared, unlike  King Charles – the other King Charles,  not King Charlie Munger –  who has been preparing  for his job as king of England now for more than 70 years.  I sometimes describe the situation like this.  Picture a football game.  At one end of the field is a quarterback.  He has great skills.  He throws a beautiful pass to the other end of the field.  And at the other end of the field are the receivers.  They've never been to a practice.  They don't know the rules of the game.  They don't know how to work together as a team.  They're clueless.  So the quarterback is the patriarch and the matriarch.  The football is the inheritance or the family business.  And  the receivers are the kids.  What are the odds that they're going to catch the football and go score a touchdown?  Probably only around 10%.  I've got the picture on the –  Just give me – No.  The – I probably observed as many – just because of my age and to some extent because of things like the giving pledges – "
518,0:52:04,0:52:11,BUFFETT," I probably observed as many particularly wealthy families the problems,  and they all are – get very particular to the family. And  in my family, I do not sign a will until my three children have read it, understand it,  and made suggestions.  Now, my children are in their 60s, and that would not have been a great success if I'd done the same thing at their 20s.  It depends on the family.  It depends on how the kids  feel about each other."
519,0:52:46,0:52:46,SPEAKER 3, There's all kinds of things.
520,0:52:47,0:52:48,SPEAKER 1, It depends on the kind of business you have.
521,0:52:48,0:52:51,BUFFETT, So there's a thousand variables.
522,0:52:51,0:52:56,SPEAKER 3," But I do think that it's – if the children  are grown and when the will is read to them, it's the first they've heard about  what the deceased thought about things, the parents have made a terrible mistake. And people – people – well, I've run into all kinds of situations, and some people don't tell their children anything, and some of them try and get them to bend to their will by using their own personal will.  They make a million mistakes, and that's one you don't get to correct."
523,0:53:32,0:53:35,SPEAKER 1," Certainly in my – well, Charlie's had a lot of experience, too. "
524,0:53:36,0:53:44,SPEAKER 7," Well, at Berkshire, we have a simple problem of estate planning.  Just hold the goddamn stock. "
525,0:53:46,0:54:04,SPEAKER 1," Well – but that doesn't fit everybody,  Charlie.  I mean – No, it only fits 95 percent.  I don't think it necessarily –  I don't know necessarily whether if you have billions of dollars you want to leave it to all your children. "
526,0:54:04,0:54:10,SPEAKER 7," I mean, that's something – Well, that's another question, but if you're going to place it somewhere,  I just assume it has Berkshire stock.  Yeah. "
527,0:54:10,0:54:22,SPEAKER 1," Oh, you're solving the investment problem for them.  Yes, yes.  But you've got the personal problem of the fact that when there were four,  one of the kids pulled the other kid's cat's tail or something like that. "
528,0:54:22,0:54:24,BUFFETT," I mean, you're dealing with human beings,  and the biggest thing you want is you want – you want your children to get along, and you want that all through your life.  And the estate isn't the only place where you can mess that up, but it's a place where it's a very easy – I mean, I know a number of cases where the  people did not know what was in the will,  whether we're using something that's involved,  and within about 15 minutes,  each one of them had a lawyer, and they don't get along since.  It's important to handle it right, and it's important if you want your kids to have a certain value, certain values,  it's important that you live those values.  It's important that you talk about it to them."
529,0:55:13,0:55:22,SPEAKER 5," They're learning from you from the day they're born what you're really like,  and don't think that a cleverly drawn will will substitute for your own behavior in teaching your kids the values you hope that they will have.  And then your will should be in conjunction with that.  It should start expressing, and they grow older, and then they learn to pass along their values in connection with the size of the state.  If there's family farms,  it's one thing.  If it's a bunch of marketable securities, it's something else.  But I know one instance by a particularly rich fellow that once a year, he'd get his kids together and have a dinner and do all kinds of things to get them to sign their income tax returns  in blank because he didn't want them to know how much money they had and everything.  Well, if that isn't going to work, I mean, I don't know what necessarily will work with him, but if you want—you know, Charlie and I have said it, you know, if you want to figure out how you want to live your life,  you write your obituary and reverse engineer it."
530,0:56:33,0:56:42,BUFFETT," I mean, you know, and Paul Andrews, incidentally, who you mentioned,  TTI, lived this great a life as anybody I've known.  And he thought about these problems, and he came to me.  He was 61, I think, had all the money way beyond what he needed.  He didn't care about—he liked to give it to people.  He had all kinds of good things he wanted to do.  And he said, for a year, I've been worried about my business, TTI. And he said, I've got all the money I need.  The family's got all the money that I need."
531,0:57:08,0:57:10,SPEAKER 1, But what do I do with the business?  These people have  helped me throughout my life.
532,0:57:13,0:57:22,BUFFETT," He says, I could sell it to a competitor.  If I sold it to a competitor,  they'd fire my people and keep their people when they put it together.  And if I sell it to a private equity firm or somebody, they'll be figuring their exit  strategy as they sign the  papers. And he said, I've been thinking about it a year.  And he said, it isn't that you're such a great guy.  He said, it's just you're the only one left. And we bought it,  and we lived happily ever after.  And that was a man that knew what life was about."
533,0:57:50,0:57:53,SPEAKER 1," So with that, let's go on to Becky. "
534,0:57:58,0:58:48,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Don Glickstein in Seattle.  He says, Warren has criticized Norfolk Southern's handling of its train derailment,  yet has been silent about BNSF's conduct.  A federal judge ruled in March that BNSF intentionally and illegally violated  an easement agreement on tribal land in Washington state  by transporting long trains of crude oil.  The same month the judge made his ruling,  a BNSF train derailed on tribal land,  spilling oil in an environmentally sensitive area.  What is Warren doing to ensure that BNSF and other Berkshire subsidiaries fulfill their ethical responsibilities?  He says he's been a Berkshire owner for more than two decades,  and he's concerned that Berkshire has no systems to identify and dress what he calls reprehensible  behavior at BNSF and other subsidiaries. "
535,0:58:49,0:58:50,SPEAKER 1, Greg?  Sure.
536,0:58:52,1:01:02,SPEAKER 3," So it is a valid issue that our team obviously has been dealing with at BNSF.  We did move crude across that tribal land.  We had an agreement that allowed us to move X number of units per day,  and we did breach it.  We went over it.  There were some fundamental breakdowns  there in that our team didn't understand the number of  trains that they could move.  We have had significant discussions with the tribe looking to resolve the issue,  recognizing we obviously benefited from moving those trains,  and those type of discussions will  continue.  I would say there's lessons learned there that we have to,  when we make a commitment,  understand what that commitment is and live by it,  or don't assume we can just  move our trains as we wish,  or the cargo as we wish.  We have to respect those agreements.  So there's been a moment learned there,  but at the same time,  we've taken it very seriously and attempted to  reach a resolution there.  And at some point,  I hope we do come to a true resolution that's fair both to the tribe and to BNSF.  On the derailment side,  we did have an issue around the track derailed.  We worked very closely with the tribe to mitigate that issue instantly,  or at least over a very reasonable period of time.  They were very responsive.  Our team was very responsive.  And there were really no long-term environmental impacts to that spill.  And as our team's highlighted in other comments,  obviously, derailments do occur in the industry.  We take them incredibly serious.  They're not all hazardous,  but irrespective of that,  we're constantly looking at how do we prevent them?  How do we detect them when we potentially have one that's  going to occur?  And what do we do with our trains?  And then ultimately, it comes down to responding properly,  because they will occur. And I think we have an incredibly dedicated team that's always ready to respond to the communities they're impacting."
537,1:01:10,1:01:14,SPEAKER 1, There are derailments.
538,1:01:14,1:01:15,SPEAKER 5, How many a year?
539,1:01:16,1:01:21,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, well, there's a thousand plus in the industry.  Yeah, yeah.   You start hauling freight,  and we're a common carrier.  And we take heavy, very heavy freight, and we take them at 100 degrees."
540,1:01:30,1:01:31,BUFFETT," But it's the  weather, and we take it at zero. And we go around curves, and we have grades. And even a 1% grade if you're going down a hill with, I don't know how much weight behind you.  I mean,  railroading is not an easy business. And of course, the systems were designed basically in the  late 1800s, the mid to late 1800s. And we have 22,000, I think it is, miles of track. And that doesn't count sidings and some other things.  It is not an easy business.  We'll make mistakes.  Our job, we're not making a mistake because we have a derailment.  We will have derailments 10 and 20 years or 30 years from now.  And  we have to carry certain products we wish we didn't  have to carry.  We're a common carrier.  Do we like carrying chlorine and ammonia and all of that?  No.  But they're going to move from one place to another in this society,  and we are a common carrier. And we load them if they select our railroad."
541,1:02:44,1:02:47,SPEAKER 1," But  we are better than we used to be,  but we've got a long  way to go, I think."
542,1:02:49,1:02:50,SPEAKER 5, Is that a fair enough statement?
543,1:02:50,1:02:50,SPEAKER 3, Absolutely.
544,1:02:51,1:02:53,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  OK, station five. "
545,1:02:57,1:02:57,SPEAKER 2," Hi,  Mr.  Warren and Ms.  Munger.  My name is Su Jinghua from China,  Zhu Ning Long Dao Company.  And first of all,  I'm so excited and very honored to be here today.  And my question is,  with more and more people focusing on  environmental protection and the government supporting the new energy industry as well,  so what are your thoughts on the continued development of new energy?  How may the new  energy firm achieve better development in the future? "
546,1:03:32,1:03:40,BUFFETT," Yeah, well, Greg, I think it's the best  to answer that because he,  since we bought a company called MidAmerican,  but now called Berkshire"
547,1:03:41,1:03:53,SPEAKER 1," Hathaway Energy, but he has been talking about it yearly, preparing reports,  hoping that we can help solve a number of the problems.  And we probably spent more money than any utility,  I would guess, in the United States. And we've just scratched the surface.  But it is not easy when you cross state lines.  I mean, you've got different jurisdictions.  And this country should be ahead of where it is in terms of transmission. And we have been the biggest factor in helping that.  But why don't you tell them a little bit about it?  Sure."
548,1:04:23,1:07:13,SPEAKER 3," Thanks, Warren.  So there's no question there's an energy transformation going on around the globe.  And as Warren touched on,  in the US, and in some ways,  I would hope here in the US, it would be,  we'd at least have a clear plan across the nation as to how to approach that.  But the reality is,  it is state by state,  with some exceptions.  But so as a result,  when you think of Berkshire Hathaway Energy,  we own three US utilities there.  And they'll participate in multiple states.  But they're developing plans state by state,  and then trying to integrate them across the various states.  The opportunities are significant,  because there is a transformation going on.  We've outlined our goal on where we're going relative to carbon at BHE, where they'll,  by 2030, reduce their carbon footprint by 50% relative to 2005.  So that's the Paris Accord and the standard they want to hold the utility industry or the utility companies to.  And we're well on that path.  But to achieve it is a true journey.  I've often talked to Warren,  when we bought Pacific Corp back in the mid-2000s,  we immediately recognized to build a lot of renewable energy like we'd been doing in the Midwest in Iowa.  But that was basically in a single state.  Now, Pacific Corp, we're in six states.  We started that back in the mid-2000s.  Here we are, and we laid out a great transmission plan.  Here's how we're going to build it.  Here's how we're going to  effectuate it, and all the benefits for our customers over that period of time.  Here we are in 2023,  and we have a little more than a third of that.  At the time, it was a $6 billion transmission project.  Today, we have a little more than a third of it built, and we've spent  probably closer to $7 billion.  And it's the right outcome.  It's still a great outcome for our customers.  But that transmission,  as part of the transformation,  you absolutely have to build it to remove all that renewable energy.  And that's sort of the complexity Warren was highlighting.  You can't just wake up one day and solve this problem.  You start with transmission,  and then you build the resources.  But at that same company,  and if we look at what we're doing across BHE Energy and that energy transformation,  we have $70 billion of known projects that are really required to properly serve our customers and achieve that type of energy transformation across those utilities.  And that's in the coming 10 years. "
549,1:07:13,1:07:13,SPEAKER 1," So  we have a team that's absolutely up to the challenge.  They're delivering on their commitments,  and it's a very good business opportunity for each of our companies and for our shareholders.  Because as we deploy that capital,  we obviously earn a return on equity of it.  But it will be a long journey.  It'll happen over an extended period of time.  And the further you get out there,  the more dependent upon the evolution of a variety of technologies  that are progressing but not there yet."
550,1:07:48,1:08:09,SPEAKER 5," You've raised a question.  I want to just take an extra minute on it because it's so important.  And I don't really know whether our form of government is ideal at all in terms of solving the problem you describe.  We have solved at one time in World War II,  we took a country that was semi-limping along, and we found ourselves in a world war.  And what we did in a world war is we brought a bunch of people to Washington at a dollar a year,  whether it was Sidney Weinberg or Goldman Sachs, you just name them.  And we gave them enormous power to reorient the resources of the United States to face the problem that they faced, which was to create a war machine. And what they did was they found Henry Kaiser and told him to build ships. And they went to the Ford Motor Company and said, you build tanks and some airplanes. And they reordered the industrial enterprise of the United States in a way that was unbelievable because they had the power of the federal government and they had the ingenuity of American business.  And they had the facilities of American business. And it led to a very successful outcome."
551,1:09:19,1:09:24,BUFFETT," But can we do that in a peacetime where you've got 50 states and  you have to get them to cooperate and you don't have anyone that, you can issue orders, but you can't designate where the capital goes at the other end and we try and do it with tax incentives and all that sort of thing.  But we haven't created the unity of purpose and the machinery that worked in World War II where essentially everybody felt  their one job was to win the war and we figured out how to use our industrial capacity to, in effect, defeat the Axis powers. And how do you recreate that  with the present democratic system?"
552,1:10:12,1:10:14,SPEAKER 3," I'm not sure I know the answer,  but I sure know the problem.  And I think that if you can think of a, if you've got an emergency on your hand,  I mean, you really need to re-engineer the energy system in the United States.  I don't think you can do it  without something  resembling the machinery, the urgency, whatever.  Remember,  the capital is there.  The people are there. "
553,1:10:44,1:10:47,SPEAKER 1," The objective is obvious.  And we just don't seem to be able to do it  in a peacetime where we're used to following a given set of  procedure. And China's got one country and we've got 50 states and we've got a whole different system of government that we should be up to the test, but so far it hasn't worked.  So thank you for the question.  Becky? "
554,1:11:20,1:11:32,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Chris Freed in Philadelphia.  He says, we know that Greg Abel and Ajit Jain are the next generation of Berkshire leaders.  Who are currently behind Greg and Ajit in their respective roles? "
555,1:11:33,1:11:34,SPEAKER 1, Respective.
556,1:11:37,1:11:37,SPEAKER 2," Well, that  will be the question that they give their, well, Greg will be, at some things, an extraordinary circumstance, but he's going to succeed me. And then he will have,  be sitting in a position where he needs his equivalent or something close to his equivalent, because he's better at many things than I've been."
557,1:12:09,1:12:12,SPEAKER 5," He will need that substitute.  And when the question comes,  where we know Ajit's opinion on that, but Greg will probably be the one that will make the final decision.  I mean, it's his responsibility.  And  Ajit will give him his best advice. And I think the odds are very, very, very high that Greg would follow it.  But those are not easy questions. "
558,1:12:41,1:12:45,BUFFETT," It isn't like we've,  everybody talks about the executive bench and all of that sort of thing,  which is baloney.  I mean, you don't have that many people that  can run five, the largest gap net worth company, and all kinds of diverse businesses.  But you don't need five people either. And you need a lot of good operating managers, and you need somebody at the top that allocates capital and make sure that  you've got the right operating manager.  And we've designed something where we separate the insurance and the rest of the business, and I think it's a very good design."
559,1:13:22,1:13:31,SPEAKER 3," But they would not be smart,  we wouldn't be smart to name that decision now about the two different  areas of the business, because a lot can change between now and then. And the most likely change is if this job changes.  Charlie?"
560,1:13:43,1:13:45,SPEAKER 7," I've got nothing to  add.  We have a lot of good people that are in the British subsidiaries.  And there's a reason why our operations have,  by and large, done better than other big conglomerate companies.  And one of them is that  we change managers way less frequently than other people do.  And that's helped us. "
561,1:14:15,1:14:22,SPEAKER 1," When Paul Andrews died,  we knew who he thought  should take over there,  but there wasn't any reason to  announce that.  I mean, Paul Andrews would have,  I wish he'd lived to be 100.  We had one of our managers die not long ago. "
562,1:14:30,1:14:35,SPEAKER 3," How old was he,  Garen?  Yeah, mid-90s, Seymour. "
563,1:14:35,1:14:40,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, Seymour Lichtenstein.  And Seymour,  I wrote him a letter when he was 80,  and I said, you know, I'm glad you're 80, and I'll write you again when you're 90. And I wrote him again when he was 90,  and he didn't make it to 100.  But he had a terrific  fellow following him, and it really managed to jointly,  to some extent, as the years went by.  But it's case by case.  And the main thing to do is have the right person running the whole place.  Okay.  Station six.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.  Buffett.  Thank you.  And thank Derek Maughan,  who actually had been over in Japan before that,  and who I met for  the first time the day before I put him in, and he turned out to, it wouldn't have worked if Derek hadn't come.  So whatever you taught him in Japan, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Now my question.  Time to time,  you have reminded us  to not bet against America.  What do you think are the most important things for U.S.  to remain strong?  And on the risk side,  if the strength of the country is undermined,  what could be the reasons?   Well, we've had a  lot of tests.  I mean, we're such a young country.  When you think about  Japan and you think about the United States,  it's just incredible how new we are to the bloc.  I mean, what are we, 234 years old since we started?"
564,1:16:45,1:16:47,SPEAKER 3, That's nothing.
565,1:16:48,1:17:03,SPEAKER 1," I mean, Charlie and I combined are two-thirds of,  we've lived two-thirds of the life of the country.  So,  and I mean, it really has, I mean, we've been tested at 46 national elections, but,  and we made some bad choices and we've had a civil war.   I mean, so the country has had  enormous advantages though in some way,  because we started with one half of 1% of the world's population in 1790,  and we now have something close to 25% of the world's GDP. And it wasn't because we had some incredible advantage in terms of, and it was nice to have two oceans on each side back when people tried to rule the world by ruling the waves."
566,1:17:34,1:17:34,SPEAKER 5," But,  you know, and we had good neighbors in Canada and Mexico, but it's a miracle.  And you say, how do we keep the good parts of the system while calling out our obvious defects? And we do it in a very herky-jerky manner, but net,  the United States is a better place to live than it was when I was born by a huge factor."
567,1:18:05,1:18:08,SPEAKER 3," I mean, I just got a root canal a week ago,  and I was just thinking,  I don't know who even invented Novocain, but I'm for him."
568,1:18:14,1:18:18,SPEAKER 5," But in a million ways,  I mean, you can romanticize about the past, but forget it.  It is work, but now we do have an atom bomb and we wish nuclear power,  you know, we wish the atom had never been split, but it has been, and you can't put it back in the bottle."
569,1:18:37,1:18:42,SPEAKER 1," So the challenges are huge.  Our government always looks,  you know, my dad was in Congress back in the 1940s, and it looked like a mess then,  you know, although it was unified by the war to some degree, but it was still very partisan."
570,1:18:55,1:18:56,SPEAKER 5," Now, the problem we have,  I think, is that partisanship, it seems to me, has moved toward tribalism, and tribalism just doesn't work as well.  I mean,  when it gets to tribalism, you don't even hear the other side, and tribalism can lead to mobs."
571,1:19:15,1:19:17,SPEAKER 1," I mean, it just, it flows. "
572,1:19:17,1:19:18,SPEAKER 5," I mean, you've seen it elsewhere,  we've seen it to a degree here."
573,1:19:21,1:19:31,SPEAKER 3," So we have to refine in a certain way our democracy as we go along,  and we deal with the world we live in.  But  if I still had a choice of any place to be born in the world, I'd want to be born in the United States, and I'd want to be born today."
574,1:19:41,1:19:54,BUFFETT," I mean, it is a better world than we've ever had,  and with present-day communications,  we can also see much more how terrible it is in many ways.  And it's got problems."
575,1:19:58,1:20:02,SPEAKER 5," When I was born in 1930,  there were 2 billion people in the world,  and now there's maybe 7.7 billion and growing. And we went millennia with really no change in population."
576,1:20:13,1:20:14,BUFFETT," So we,  and of course, we've introduced energy into, in an incredible way,  into something where we now have 7.7 billion people using way more energy than they did when I was born,  when there were 2 billion people."
577,1:20:31,1:20:40,SPEAKER 3," So it's  an exciting world, it's a challenging world.  And I don't know the solutions on things.   I do think that we do need to think about different solutions in terms of how we get important  problems solved, and that we don't kid ourselves  that something magic will happen,  or that everybody will get together and we'll all just cheer, and it'll go away by 2050 or anything. And how well we adapt to that, we will see.  I would say, so far, it doesn't look very promising.  But then I'm sure that  when Lincoln looked at it, what was going on in the Civil War didn't look very promising either.  So I think that the U.S. is capable of doing remarkable things, and I think it wouldn't surprise me if they do it again.  Charlie, are you part of the…"
578,1:21:27,1:22:01,SPEAKER 7," Well, I'm slightly less optimistic than Warren is.  I think the best road ahead to human happiness is to expect less.  I think it's going to get tougher.  And I think the solution of having a huge proportion of the  young and brilliant people all go into wealth management  is a crazy development in terms of its natural consequences for American civilization.  We don't need as many wealth managers as we have. "
579,1:22:02,1:22:11,SPEAKER 1," You would… Charlie was born on January 1st, 1924,  and you'd hate to go back to that,  wouldn't you, Charlie? "
580,1:22:11,1:22:28,SPEAKER 7," Yes, I would.  And I like more wealth managers who are just merely reflecting the fact that there's more wealth.  But we've got…  I don't like everybody going into wealth management,  MIT or something.  I think the world's a little crazy now. "
581,1:22:32,1:22:35,SPEAKER 1," Take your choice.  Okay, Becky.  This  question comes from Dennis DeGennaro.  As Warren stated in the 2022 annual report,  Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash in U.S."
582,1:22:48,1:22:48,SPEAKER 3, Treasury bills.
583,1:22:49,1:23:39,SPEAKER 6," It will also avoid behavior  that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times,  including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses.  After Warren passes away,  his A shares will be converted into  B shares and distributed to various foundations.  These foundations will then sell the shares  to fund their causes.  Warren estimates it will take 12 to 15 years for all his shares to be sold.  I worry that a corporate raider like Kyral Icahn or a group will buy up enough  of these shares to take control of Berkshire and completely disregard Warren's philosophy  of holding a lot of cash in U.S.  Treasury bills and instead be greedy,  reckless, and highly speculative and ruin Berkshire's position as a rock-solid financial fortress.  I also worry that changes might be made in how Berkshire's subsidiaries are run.  Do Warren and Charlie worry that these things could happen? "
584,1:23:40,1:23:47,SPEAKER 1," Well,  I think it's fair to say we think about it plenty,  but I don't worry enormously. "
585,1:23:47,1:23:51,BUFFETT, It is true that
586,1:23:52,1:24:12,SPEAKER 1, Greg and the directors will have a honeymoon period for a long time simply because of the boats that will still remain.  But it's true that eventually they will get judged based on how well our operation fares versus others.
587,1:24:12,1:24:12,BUFFETT," Now, if we don't  pay any dividends in 12 or 15 years,  you're talking a trillion and a half that it would take to take over. And I think if we can't—that limits the group."
588,1:24:26,1:24:36,SPEAKER 5, They like to think about how much they can borrow against it.  It doesn't work when you—and some of these—there's nobody to come close to doing it  themselves. And I think that the important thing is that Berkshire be regarded as a national asset rather than a national liability.
589,1:24:48,1:25:01,SPEAKER 1," We've got to be a plus to the country with our form of operation.  And we certainly have got a record,  which will then be 12 or 15 years longer,  done with much more capital,  more companies."
590,1:25:02,1:25:15,SPEAKER 5," More things will have happened where our hundreds of billions can work its way into the economy in terms of  lots of jobs, lots of products,  lots of behavior.  And it can be compared with other things.  So I  think we went out if we deserve to went out.  And I think the odds of that happening are very, very, very high."
591,1:25:29,1:25:29,SPEAKER 3, Charlie?
592,1:25:29,1:26:00,SPEAKER 7," Well, we—I don't spend much time worrying about something that could have happened 50 years ago,  and after I'm dead.  I think if you sort of take care of each day's responsibilities pretty well and  think ahead as well as you can,  then you just take the results as they fall.  So I'm philosophical,  but I'm not—I'd be spreading unnecessarily. "
593,1:26:04,1:26:10,SPEAKER 1," OK.  Neither one of us are worried,  basically.  But we plan. "
594,1:26:10,1:26:11,SPEAKER 3, We do plan.
595,1:26:11,1:26:14,BUFFETT," And, you know, I've got a model in my mind of what "
596,1:26:15,1:26:42,SPEAKER 1," Berkshire has been.  That model has been modified plenty of times over 58 years.  The one thing I knew initially is—or very quickly—was it shouldn't be a textile company.  That was an important decision.  And we've just played the hand as it's come along,  and we've made a few really good decisions,  and we'll never make a decision that kills us.  The only things that are a threat to the planet,  we don't have any answer for those.  But  we do—we keep ourselves in better shape  than anybody else, and we just aren't going to have big maturities of debt that come along.  We aren't going to have  insurance policies that can be cashed in en masse,  and we will sit with a large—what looks like a huge amount of capital.  It is a huge amount of capital,  but there's a huge amount of earning power.  There's a huge amount of diversity, everything.  So our business model will be graded,  and it will be graded against a lot of people that we'd like to be graded against. "
597,1:27:23,1:27:35,SPEAKER 5," So I think we're handing something very secure over to the future,  and I think we've got the shareholder base like nobody has.  I mean, there isn't anybody in the country that I know of,  unless they've had an  employee-owned company prior to going public or something of the sort.  But this is the product of  58 years of regarding the shareholder as the owner of the company."
598,1:27:54,1:27:55,SPEAKER 3, But what does that mean?
599,1:27:55,1:27:57,SPEAKER 2, That means having happy customers.
600,1:27:57,1:28:10,BUFFETT," It means being—it means being welcomed by your community rather than having them turn you away.  It means that the government feels better with you if there's a financial crisis,  because you can provide something that actually the company—the country can't under some circumstances,  and you'll be there. And at the same time, it'll be good for the business. And we will have crises of one sort or another, but  if they aren't challenging the planet,  which worries you in terms of some of the threats that we have, we'll be a plus to the United States, and if we're a plus to the United States, we'll survive."
601,1:28:43,1:28:53,SPEAKER 1, Okay.  Station 7.  Mr.
602,1:28:53,1:28:54,SPEAKER 2, Buffett and Mr.
603,1:28:54,1:28:55,SPEAKER 1," Munger,  thank you for having us this weekend.  My name is Beau Clayton,  and I'm from Durham, North Carolina.  One of the reasons that we are all here is that you're great storytellers,  and we carry those stories back home with us.  Can you please share a couple stories that maybe we haven't heard before about Mr.  Abel and Mr.  Jane that capture their character and their caliber as leaders?  Well,  I'll start out with the G.  He walked into the office in  1986,  and I'd gotten the bright idea of going into the reinsurance business, I think, in maybe 1969."
604,1:29:52,1:29:57,SPEAKER 3," So I'd stumbled along for 17 years,  and I had a wonderful guy that ran it, but he also liked certain brokers."
605,1:30:08,1:30:10,BUFFETT," I mean, he was running it  the traditional way, the top quality and everything else, but  he fell into the—he didn't try and change the system.  He tried to improve the system to some degree, and we just—we went nowhere."
606,1:30:31,1:30:34,SPEAKER 5," Seventeen years wandering around in the wilderness,  and I thought I was—I knew we could have something  good.  And then G.  came in on a Saturday, and Mike Oldberg steered him in, I think,  and Mike deserves to be enshrined in perpetuity for that act.  And I talked with him a while—I  think maybe I was opening the mail on Saturday while I talked with him, and he had absolutely zero experience with insurance, but he'd actually seen a good bit of how corporate America operated, because he'd been in management consulting. And after talking with him,  I knew I'd struck gold.  And so I hired him and gave him the backing of some money, and we had a very good period in the market, almost right away for him to act. And the G,  you know, if I had the top pick of 10 insurance managers in the world, I could take all 10, and they wouldn't—you can't replace a G. And we still enjoy talking."
607,1:31:56,1:32:01,SPEAKER 1," We don't talk as frequently as we used to,  but we used to talk about it every day.  But  he is—he's one of a kind."
608,1:32:05,1:32:06,SPEAKER 3," And,  you know, if you're going to stick around long enough, you only need one of a kind."
609,1:32:11,1:32:13,SPEAKER 1," Paul Andrews stuck around at TTI,  had all the money in the world."
610,1:32:16,1:32:17,SPEAKER 3," Every time I talked to him  about getting a raise  or something of the sort, he said, we'll talk about that next year.  It just—he  was not what you get when you get the top draft picks from the leading business schools.  And I will say this.  I have never looked at where anybody went to school in terms of hiring.  I mean, I just—somebody mailed me a resume or something."
611,1:32:39,1:32:41,SPEAKER 2," I don't care where they went to school.  And it just so happens that Ajit went to some pretty good schools, but he isn't Ajit because he went to other schools."
612,1:32:51,1:32:57,SPEAKER 1," And, Charlie, you can tell a story or two.  How did you find Louis Bensenty? "
613,1:32:58,1:33:00,SPEAKER 7," Well, he was there. "
614,1:33:02,1:33:04,SPEAKER 1, But you've got to recognize him.
615,1:33:04,1:33:25,SPEAKER 7," I asked Louis once how he managed to play first-string football at, I think, Stanford,  when he only weighed 175 pounds.  And he said, well, he said, I was pretty quick.  And he was pretty quick.  We have found a lot of people within our companies who are pretty quick. "
616,1:33:26,1:33:32,SPEAKER 1," We had one guy that quit at fourth grade,  didn't we, in Ben Rosner.  Am I wrong? "
617,1:33:32,1:33:56,SPEAKER 7," Oh, yeah, totally self-educated.  Ben Rosner knew more about retailing in difficult neighborhoods than anybody.  And he watched everything in his business like a hawk.  He was amazing.  Now, there was an example.  We never found anybody who could do what—when Ben died,  that ability left us. "
618,1:33:57,1:33:58,BUFFETT," Yeah, and you want a story,  it's kind of interesting,  because Ben Rosner had a partner, Leo Simon.  And Leo Simon was Mo Annenberg's son-in-law. And Leo, therefore, was very, very, very wealthy. And Ben started with nothing.  But they liked each other.  And one time,  well before they got involved in the business, the business we bought—but  they got the idea of buying a submarine from World War I and taking it to the Century of Progress,  which was the World's Fair,  in effect, in Chicago, I think, in 1933.  So they bought the submarine for practically nothing.  And they figured, you know, the average guy from Omaha was going to his first World's Fair,  get into a submarine for a quarter or  something, that they'd pay it.  So they hauled it  from Florida, wherever they got it."
619,1:35:04,1:35:05,SPEAKER 1," They hauled it to Chicago.  And then they got into Chicago, and they were hauling a submarine down the streets of Chicago.  And it was creating traffic problems like nobody could imagine."
620,1:35:18,1:35:20,SPEAKER 2," So a cop came over,  and he said to Ben, he said, where do you think you guys are going  with that submarine?"
621,1:35:29,1:35:30,SPEAKER 3," Ben says,  he says, well, I don't—he says, you'll have to talk to  my partner, Mr."
622,1:35:34,1:35:34,SPEAKER 1," Capone.  And the cop says, you're on."
623,1:35:38,1:35:54,SPEAKER 5," Just keep going.  And that was Ben Rosner.  And then Leo Simon died.  And when he died in 1967 or so,  Ben Rosner kept delivering  half the profits to his widow,  who was incredibly rich, of course, being Mo Annenberg's  firstborn daughter.  I think Mo had nine girls in a row before Walter came along,  the tenth."
624,1:36:08,1:36:13,BUFFETT," I may be off by one.  But anyway,  I went to this fancy apartment.  And anyway, Ben kept her in for half the deal. And he had her sign the rent checks,  just so she would look like she was doing something in this business. And she didn't need the money, obviously, but he just felt he was  obligated once his partner Leo died.  And then she started criticizing him. And at that point, Ben went to her—his lawyer—or it was her lawyer, actually, Will Fahlsteiner."
625,1:36:44,1:36:47,SPEAKER 1," I don't know whatever happened to Will,  but he gave me—he gave me a call,  because Ben wanted to call me, because he wanted me to buy it. And he wanted me—if I bought it, he'd be rid of the partner's—ex-partner's wife. And he'd get—he had me and Charlie come back, and we went to Will Fahlsteiner's office.  And Ben says, I'll work till the  end of the year, and that's all,  but I'll sell you this thing for $6 million,  and I have $2 million of cash and a couple million of real estate and a couple million of operating earnings.  I said, this is crazy.  But  he felt if he was getting a lousy price,  she was taking a half of the lousy price for half the money. "
626,1:37:29,1:37:34,BUFFETT, So he looked at me at some point.
627,1:37:35,1:37:36,SPEAKER 1," Charlie, you describe the rest of it. "
628,1:37:36,1:37:37,SPEAKER 3, Look at it again.
629,1:37:37,1:37:42,SPEAKER 7," He said, I heard here you're the fastest drawer in the West.  He says, draw. "
630,1:37:43,1:37:46,SPEAKER 3," We're in a New York lawyer's office,  and this guy is—he's selling his baby.  And he told us he was leaving."
631,1:37:52,1:38:00,SPEAKER 1," I got Charlie on the side.  I said,  if this guy leaves at the end of the year,  you can throw away every psychology book that's ever been written.  I mean, it isn't going to happen.  And so we bought it, and we lived happily ever after with Ben. And one time, he was taking me over to see a property we had in Brooklyn. And along the way, I said, Ben, I promised you I wouldn't interfere in the business when we started.  And he knew a but was coming,  and he just said, thank you, Warren. And then he shut me up."
632,1:38:31,1:38:31,SPEAKER 3, He was a lot of fun.
633,1:38:32,1:38:36,SPEAKER 1," We have so many Ben Rosner stories,  but now you've heard one that hasn't been published before.  OK, Becky. "
634,1:38:39,1:39:14,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Chai Gohil.  He writes—this is for Ajit—reinsurance industry is going through one of the hardest pricing environments in the last 15 years.  Berkshire historically has participated during these stress times when economic returns are very attractive.  This year, it appears Berkshire has not been interested in deploying its resources towards property cat reinsurance despite such strong returns.  Can you elaborate on reasons for not participating despite these returns?  And your broader view on how you're planning to shape your reinsurance business post-acquisition of Allegheny? "
635,1:39:14,1:39:17,SPEAKER 1, OK.
636,1:39:17,1:39:32,BUFFETT," In terms of Allegheny,  that's an easy response.  We look—we treat our operating units independent of each other.  And as far as Allegheny is concerned,  they have a major presence in the reinsurance business  under the brand name of Transatlantic "
637,1:39:33,1:39:33,SPEAKER 1, Re.
638,1:39:33,1:39:47,BUFFETT," That company will operate the way it's been operating in the past.  There'll be no change in terms of strategy or management,  and they will keep doing what they're doing.  They've been very successful,  and hopefully they'll keep being successful. "
639,1:39:49,1:39:49,SPEAKER 1," Now,  in terms of the property cat business that I have been active in over these last several years,  you are right that the last 15 years  has been a difficult time.  Prices have not been attractive.  And even though we have had some presence in the property cat business in the last 15 years,  it really has been minimal.  This December 31st, which is a big renewal date for cat reinsurance,  we were hoping that we would get a few days in the sun and we'd be able to deploy our capital and  be able to write some fairly attractive business.  As it happened towards the end of  December, till about the third week of December,  I was very optimistic that we would get a chance to  put several billion dollars on the books.  But in the last 10 days of December,  unfortunately,  a lot of capacity came out of the woodworks.  Pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come  and meet our pricing requirements,  as a result of which  January 1 was a big disappointment.  We did not write as much as we were hoping to write.  Now, fast forward to April 1,  which is another big renewal date,  we had a lot of powder dry.  And we were lucky that we kept the powder dry,  because April 1, suddenly prices zoomed up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1  and started to look attractive to us.  So now we have a portfolio that is very heavily exposed to property catastrophe.  To put that in perspective,  our exposure today is almost 50%  more than what it was five, six months ago.  So I think we have written as much as our capacity will  allow us to write."
640,1:41:45,1:41:46,SPEAKER 10, We are very happy with what we've written.
641,1:41:47,1:42:42,BUFFETT," The margins have been healthy.  The only thing that I want to mention to you is that while  the margins have been healthy,  we have a very unbalanced portfolio.  What that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida,  we will have a very substantial loss.  As opposed to that,  if we have a very big loss anywhere other than Florida,  relative to our competition,  we will have a much smaller loss.  Net-net,  I'm very happy with the portfolio.  It is a lot better than what it's been in the past.  I don't know how long it will last.  And of course,  if the hurricane happens in Florida,  we could lose,  across all the units,  we could lose as much as $15 billion.  And if there isn't a loss,  we'll make several billion dollars' profit. "
642,1:42:44,1:42:57,SPEAKER 1," And, G, tell them how long,  when you called me and said you'd like to expose us to whatever it was,  a couple billion more of exposure,  how long it took to say yes?  Yeah. "
643,1:42:57,1:43:16,BUFFETT," So the way we think about our exposure is,  you know, in the property, in the insurance operations collectively across the entire company,  given that we have about a little less than $300 billion of capital,  we think of that as a 5% exposure that we're willing to take on. "
644,1:43:17,1:43:17,SPEAKER 1," So,  to complete Warren's story,  a few weeks ago,  we had about $13 billion of exposure all across the globe.  And I called up Warren,  I said, we're up to 13,  it'll be nice if we can go up to 15,  that's a good round number.  And that was less than a 30-second phone call.  I think Warren said yes without even listening to what the numbers were.  I hope he calls me again.  Okay, station 8.  Hello. "
645,1:43:53,1:44:55,SPEAKER 2," My name is Adal Flores,  and I've been a shareholder for about 16 years,  and I'm coming from Guadalajara, Mexico.  My question is for Warren and Charlie.  Companies have the eternal dilemma between building products that can make profits and increase their company competitive position.  In the best case,  you can build products that have both characteristics at the same time, like Google did.  But most of the time,  companies need to choose between short-term profits and long-term defensibility.  For example, Amazon was focused on building their famous Amazon Flywheel,  with limited profits initially,  in order to obtain stronger network effects,  with the hope of getting more defensible profits in the future.  When you invest,  you constantly speak about the importance of building competitive modes.  What advice would you give to CEOs about how to balance this dilemma,  which is essentially short-term  profits versus long-term defensibility?  Thank you. "
646,1:44:55,1:45:01,SPEAKER 1," Well, the answer is to control your destiny,  which we've been able to do at Berkshire. "
647,1:45:01,1:45:07,SPEAKER 2, So we feel no pressure from Wall Street.
648,1:45:08,1:45:11,SPEAKER 1, We don't have investor calls.
649,1:45:11,1:45:16,SPEAKER 3," We don't have to make promises.  We get a chance to make our own  mistakes and occasionally find something that works well.  But we recognize that  the people in this room and people like them are the ones we're working for, and we're not working for a bunch of people that care about whether we meet the quarter estimate or anything."
650,1:45:36,1:46:02,SPEAKER 5," So we have a freedom that we get to use.  And we're interested in owning a wonderful business forever.  Well, there aren't very many wonderful businesses,  but we do learn a lot as we go along.  Charlie and I have often mentioned how we learned so much when we bought See's Candy,  which we did."
651,1:46:04,1:46:19,SPEAKER 1," But we learned when we bought Ben Rogers'  chain of women's dress shops spread all over the eastern part of the country.  We learned when we tried getting into the department store business back in 1966.  And as the ink was drying on our purchase price, we realized we'd done something dumb."
652,1:46:25,1:46:29,SPEAKER 5, We're learning all the time how consumers behave.
653,1:46:30,1:46:34,SPEAKER 1," I'm not going to be able to learn the technical aspects of businesses,  but that would be nice if I knew it.  But it isn't essential.  And  we are obviously, we've got a business at Apple which is larger than our energy business. And we may only own 5.6 or 7 percent, but our ownership goes up every year.  And I don't understand the phone at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.  And I know how people think about whether to buy a second car.  I know how they go out to different,  we own auto dealerships."
654,1:47:17,1:47:31,BUFFETT," We're learning all the time from all of our businesses how people react to animals versus selling them something else.  And so See's was a sort of breakthrough,  but we just keep learning as to more about how people behave and how a good business can turn into a bad business and how some good businesses can maintain their competitive advantage over time. And so we don't have some formula."
655,1:48:01,1:48:07,SPEAKER 1, But we can also tell in 10 seconds whether it's something of interest.
656,1:48:08,1:48:14,SPEAKER 5," I mean, when I get these calls and we want to send decks and all that sort of thing,  which is nonsense.  I mean, it's a bunch of guys sitting, get paid for drawing up these projections of the future and everything like that.  If they knew the future, we don't know the future, but we do know certain kinds of businesses.  We know what the right price is and we know what we think we can project out in terms of consumer behavior and consumer and threats to a business.  And that's what we've been about and that's what we'll continue to be about. "
657,1:48:45,1:48:46,SPEAKER 3," We do get,  we don't get smarter over time."
658,1:48:49,1:48:51,SPEAKER 5," We get a little wiser though,  following it over time.  And you can do it while sitting in the office with a telephone too, which we like.  Charlie?"
659,1:48:59,1:49:04,SPEAKER 7," Well, tell them the story of the Japanese investment.  That should be told again. "
660,1:49:05,1:49:05,SPEAKER 2, That's  a nice story.
661,1:49:08,1:49:10,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Well, it was pretty simple.  I mean, I,  you know, back  when I started, other people were going through Playboy and I was going through Moody's, you know, basically.  And there's a movie out called Turn Every Page,  which I saw again for the second time a couple of days ago.  Lizzie Gottlieb and I recommend everybody in this world watch that because I turned every page in the past. And I did it for thousands and thousands of pages in Moody's and I did it at the Department of Public Utilities in"
662,1:49:42,1:49:42,SPEAKER 3," Boston.   I did it in the insurance department.  It just kept turning pages.  Well,  that goes on for a while, but now we need big ideas in order to find things. And what was your question, Charlie?  Tell them about the Japanese. "
663,1:50:01,1:50:08,BUFFETT," Well, the Japanese thing was simple.  I mean, I like looking at companies.  I mean, I like looking at  figures about companies. And here were five very, very substantial companies, understandable companies."
664,1:50:18,1:50:18,SPEAKER 1," Most of them,  maybe all of them, we'd done business with in a dozen different ways.  If you go a couple of miles from where this place is,  our last coal generating plant was built."
665,1:50:31,1:50:32,SPEAKER 3, By one of the companies.
666,1:50:33,1:50:36,SPEAKER 1," So here they were.   They were sitting as a group  where they were earning,  we'll say, 14 percent  on what we were going to pay to buy them.  They were paying decent dividends.  They were going to repurchase shares in some cases.  They owned a whole bunch of businesses that we could understand as a group, although we didn't mean we had deep understanding on any of them.  But we've seen them operate and everything. "
667,1:51:00,1:51:01,BUFFETT," There wasn't anything to it.  And at the same time,  we could take out the currency risk by financing in yen.  And that was going to cost us a half of one percent.  Well, if you get 14 percent on one side,  a half a percent on the other side. And you've got money that, you know,  forever. And they're doing intelligent things and they're sizable."
668,1:51:24,1:51:25,SPEAKER 3, So  we just started buying them.
669,1:51:28,1:51:35,SPEAKER 1," I didn't even probably tell Greg until maybe six months  after we'd gotten going.  And then when we hit five percent  in all of them,  we announced on my birthday and at 90,  that we owned over five percent and recently went over for the first time to visit with them. And we were more than pleasantly surprised, delighted with what we find there. And now we own 7.4 percent of them.  We won't go over 9.9 without their agreeing.  And we sold another 164, whatever it is."
670,1:52:07,1:52:11,BUFFETT, A billion of yen.
671,1:52:11,1:52:33,SPEAKER 1," They would have done for us if we only had five billion dollars or something  and made ten billion dollars.  Simply in that way,  we would look like heroes now,  10 billion just sort of disappears as a  little dot in Bursch's report.  But it's fun and it is fun and it is ten billion dollars.  And Charlie says it keeps and Charlie says it keeps me out of bars.  I probably talked to Charlie about this the year after I started.  I don't know.  But who knows?"
672,1:52:45,1:52:51,SPEAKER 3," I mean, I knew he'd like it.  I mean, obviously.  And we tried to do every dollar we could do. "
673,1:52:51,1:52:53,SPEAKER 7, We could only do about 10 billion.
674,1:52:54,1:52:54,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
675,1:52:54,1:52:55,SPEAKER 3," Well, not even that. "
676,1:52:55,1:52:56,SPEAKER 1," Quite that much.  Yeah.   But, you know,  we are four or five billion ahead plus dividends.  And we got a carry that's terrific. And and,  you know, and they welcome us and they should welcome us. And but we we love it the way they're operating."
677,1:53:12,1:53:18,BUFFETT, We're not there to tell them what to do in the least.  So we did.
678,1:53:19,1:53:22,SPEAKER 5," But we did say we never go over nine point nine and we mean it.  And they they know that  we'll be true to our word. And I went over there partly to introduce Greg to those people,  because we're going to be with them 10,  20, 30, 40 years from now.  And they may occasionally find something that we can do jointly.  And they look they look forward to doing that.  We look forward to it.  And in addition, we have some other operating businesses in Japan."
679,1:53:47,1:54:24,SPEAKER 1," So,  Greg, do you have anything?  The only thing I would add is that one is more than you went over there.  It was to build the build the trust with these Japanese companies,  because we do hope there's long term opportunities.  But fundamentally, as you highlighted,  they're an incredible they've been a very good investment.  I'd also highlight the five meetings we had  were really quite remarkable.  I mean, these companies,  the culture and the history around it,  how proud they are.  You know, there's just moments of learning from them.  So it was just a great experience to to spend really two days with the five companies.  And an issue that we intended to be 56 billion yen that we were issuing and selling turned out to be one hundred and sixty four point four or something like that.  Everything everything's worked so well.  And as Charlie says,  it you know, it doesn't move 500 billion of net worth that much."
680,1:54:45,1:54:47,BUFFETT," But this one is,  you know, it will keep adding over the years to the Berkshire's value with very widespread,  probably four or five hundred million dollars a year."
681,1:54:58,1:55:06,SPEAKER 5," And, you know, we'll just keep looking for more opportunities.  And and Japan,  we have  Berkshire is the largest borrower outside of corporate borrow outside of  Japan that that exists.  And we didn't set out to be that.  It's it's turned out that way. And and we're not done.  I mean, you know, in terms of  what may come along there.  And we have some direct operations there, as I mentioned.  And we've got some really wonderful partners working for us. And I don't have to do anything."
682,1:55:45,1:55:48,SPEAKER 1," OK, Becky. "
683,1:55:49,1:56:20,SPEAKER 6," The next question comes from Ellie Amin, Tibet,  who asks during an episode of investing the Templeton Way podcast, Professor Damodaran,  who he respects almost as much as Warren and Charlie mentioned that he is not comfortable with positions becoming a large part of his portfolio,  for example, when they reach twenty five to thirty five percent.  He mentioned that Apple is now thirty five percent of Berkshire's portfolio and thinks that that is near a danger zone.  Wonders if Warren and Charlie can comment. "
684,1:56:21,1:56:23,SPEAKER 1," I'll leave him in one comment first,  but Charlie will come up with. "
685,1:56:24,1:56:25,SPEAKER 7, I think he's out of his mind.
686,1:56:25,1:56:52,BUFFETT," Yeah, I know.  But  Apple is not thirty five percent of a Berkshire portfolio.  Berkshire's portfolio includes the railroad,  the energy business, animals,  you name it, sees candy.  They're all businesses.  And,  you know, the good thing about Apple is that we we can go up.  They buy in their stock and instead of owning five point six percent,  you know, they get down to they got about fifteen billion, seven hundred and some million shares outstanding."
687,1:57:01,1:57:14,SPEAKER 3," They get down to fifteen and a quarter billion without us doing anything.  We got six percent.  So we can't own more than one hundred percent of the world.  BNSF, we can't own more than one hundred percent of animals or sees candy.  And it'd be nice."
688,1:57:17,1:57:18,SPEAKER 1," We'd love to own 200 percent,  but this isn't doable.  But they're all the same.  They're good businesses.  And to think that  our criterion,  our criteria for Apple is different  than the other businesses we own.  It just happens to be a better business than any we own.  And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad. And Apple is a better business.  Our railroad is a very good business,  but it's not remotely as good as Apple's business.  But  Apple has a position with consumers where they're paying, you know, maybe they pay fifteen hundred bucks or whatever it may be for a phone.  And these same people pay thirty five thousand dollars for having a second car.  And if they had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car.  I mean, it's an extraordinary problem. "
689,1:58:17,1:58:20,SPEAKER 5, We don't have anything like that that we own a hundred percent of.
690,1:58:20,1:58:43,BUFFETT," But we're very, very, very happy to have five point six or whatever it may be percent.  And we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up.  It's like adding one hundred million dollars to our earnings.  I mean, our share of the earnings.  And they use their earnings to buy out  our partners, which we're glad to see them sell out to the index funds have to sell.  They bring the number of shares down.  And,  you know, we went up slightly last year and I made a mistake a couple of years ago when I sold some shares."
691,1:58:54,1:58:54,SPEAKER 5, I had  certain certain reasons why gains were useful to take that year from a tax standpoint.  But having heard having heard me say that it was a dumb decision.
692,1:59:10,1:59:11,SPEAKER 3," And.   Well, you've already given your comment about it,  but but we do not have thirty five percent of Berkshire's portfolio.  Berkshire's portfolio is the  funds we have to work with and we want to own good businesses and we also want to have plenty of liquidity.  And beyond that,  you know, the sky's the limit or  or our mistakes.  Who knows what the bottom is?  Charlie, do you want to add anything to your earlier comment?"
693,1:59:41,2:00:12,SPEAKER 7," Well, I think.  One of the inane things that's taught in modern university education is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory and investing in common stocks.  That is an insane idea.  It's not that easy to have a vast plethora of  good opportunities that are easily identified.  And if you've only got three,  I'd rather be in my best ideas instead of my worst. "
694,2:00:13,2:00:13,BUFFETT, And.
695,2:00:15,2:01:09,SPEAKER 7," Now some people can't tell their best ideas from their worst and in the act of deciding that  investment already is good,  they get to thinking it's better than it is.  I think we make fewer mistakes like that than other people.  And that is a blessing to us.  We're not so smart,  but we kind of know where the edge of our smartness is.  That is a very important part of  practical intelligence.  And a lot of people who are geniuses on IQ tests think they're a lot smarter than they are.  And what they are is dangerous.  And and but if you know the edge of your own ability pretty well,  you should ignore most of the notions of our experts about  what I call de-worsification of portfolios. "
696,2:01:09,2:01:12,SPEAKER 3, OK.
697,2:01:14,2:02:58,SPEAKER 1," Yeah.  Session nine.  Hi, Charlie.  Hi, Charlie and Warren.  Thank you for this superb shareholder meeting celebration.  My name is David Chung from Hong Kong and a proud graduate of Chicago Booth.  I'm also here with my two sons,  Aidan and Ashton, who's currently studying at University of Chicago as a freshman and sophomore.  This is my second time attending the conference,  last being 2019,  four years ago,  which I was only a guest shareholder of my friend Andrew.  So  after the shareholder meeting,  I have decided to buy into Berkshire Hathaway,  which has given me a great return of 62 percent since 2019.  So I want to thank you for that.  I have also taken one of your advice to give my children a share for each of their birthdays.  Although they want a Berkshire Hathaway A shares,  they will do just fine with B shares.  My question is,  how do you see the current U.S.  China Internet companies valuation and the price disparity?  Given there has been many uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions,  significant cost optimizations with leaner U.S.  tech firms,  while China Tech has been through all that already.  Thank you.  Well,  there's been some tension in the economic relationship of  the United States and China.  I think that  that tension has been wrongly created on both sides.  I think we're equally guilty of being stupid.  There's one thing we should do.  It's get along on the other side.  I think we should get along on the other side.   I think we're equally guilty of being stupid.  There's one thing we should do.  It's get along with China.  And we should have a lot of free trade with China in our mutual interest.  And I just can't imagine.  It's just so obvious.  There's so much safety and so much creativity that's possible.  Think of what Apple has done by engaging in a  partnership with China as a big supplier.  It's been good for Apple and good for China.  That's the kind of business we ought to be doing with China.  And moreover, everything that increases the tension between the two companies is stupid,  stupid, stupid.  And it ought to be stopped on each side.  And each side ought to respond to the other side's stupidity with reciprocal kindness.  That's my view.  And it creates one enormous problem,  of course, which is that you have the two superpowers of the world,  and they know they have to  get along with each other.  Either one can destroy the other.  And they're going to be competitive with each other."
698,2:04:34,2:04:40,BUFFETT," But part of it is trying,  always in a game like that,  is trying to judge how far you can push the other guy without them reacting wrong.  And if either side is a bully in some ways,  they can get away with it to an extent,  because the alternative is – would drive them both into destruction.  But if they push it too far,  they increase the probability that something really does go wrong.  So it's a – it's one of those game theory dilemmas."
699,2:05:11,2:05:26,SPEAKER 3," But you really need the leader of both countries,  and you need the populace to understand at least the general situation  in which these countries are going to operate over the next century,  and know that some leader that promises too much  can get you in a hell of a lot of trouble. And that – like, you know, you've got one kind of a system that gets its leader one way,  and you've got another system that gets its leader another way. And keeping either side from trying to play the game too hard and thinking the other side will go along, you know,  it's like playing chicken, you know, and driving toward a cliff."
700,2:06:04,2:06:12,BUFFETT," So it is – if you've got any diplomacy skills,  persuasive skills, or anything like that,  you really want people that will convince the other country as well as his own or her own country that this is what we're engaged in, we've got to do it right."
701,2:06:27,2:06:32,SPEAKER 3," We won't give away the store,  but we won't try and take the whole store either.  And it – we're just at the beginning of this, unfortunately.  I mean, we've learned what the situation was.  It used to be the Soviet. And mutually assured destruction was our policy then, and that kept a lot of things from happening."
702,2:06:53,2:06:59,BUFFETT," But it also came with a very,  very, very close call with Cuba.  And these are not – you know, these are different games than existed hundreds of years ago."
703,2:07:07,2:07:08,SPEAKER 3," You could – you know,  Britain might rule the seas or France or Spain, but now you're playing with a game that you can't really make a huge mistake in. And I think that that should be – the better that's understood in both countries, the more the leaders feel that their citizenry does understand that, the better off we'll be. And that  a lot of demography or the – a lot of inflammatory speaking, but a lot of authoritarian action,  I mean, it all carries its dangers. And the world has stumbled through the years post-1945 with a lot of close calls from the – in the nuclear arena.  And now we've got pandemics and we've got cyber and a whole bunch of other things."
704,2:08:13,2:08:18,BUFFETT, So we've got more tools of destruction than the world's ever had.  And  it's imperative that
705,2:08:23,2:08:30,SPEAKER 5, China and the United States both understand what the game is and understand that you can't push too hard.
706,2:08:31,2:08:32,SPEAKER 1," But we're going –  but both places are going to be competitive. And both can prosper.  That's what really is – that's the vision that  is out there, that  China will have a more wonderful country,  the United States will have a more wonderful country.  And the two are not just compatible, they're almost imperative in terms of what's going to happen in the next 100 years or so. And I think that the leaders of both countries have got an important job in having that  understood and not to do inflammatory things. And we'll see whether the luck that has taken us from 1945 to present holds out.  And I think we can affect to some extent that luck.  And with that shory message,  we will move to Becky."
707,2:09:36,2:10:05,SPEAKER 6," This question comes from Rohit Bellany.  Berkshire bought a substantial position in Taiwan Semiconductor and,  contrary to its normal holding timeline,  sold almost the entire position within a few short months.  While you cited in a CNBC interview that geopolitical issues were the catalyst,  these issues were seemingly no different when you acquired that stock.  So what else, if anything, changed in those few months and prompted the firm to offload close to $5 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor shares? "
708,2:10:05,2:10:08,SPEAKER 5," Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the best  managed companies and important companies in the world.  And I think you'll be able to say the same thing five or ten or twenty years from now.  I don't like its location and I've re-evaluated that.  I  mean, I don't think it should be any place but Taiwan,  although they will be obviously opening up  ship capacity in this country. And actually, one of our subsidiaries that we got in Allegheny is participating in their Arizona construction activities."
709,2:10:49,2:10:50,BUFFETT," But  it's a question of we would rather have the same kind of company. And there's nobody in the chip industry that's in their league,  at least in my view. And the man that is a 91-year-old or so that connected with it, that I think I played bridge with in Albuquerque.  And marvelous people, marvelous company, but  I'd rather find a marvelous people."
710,2:11:36,2:11:38,SPEAKER 1," I won't find it in the chip industry,  but marvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything.  I'd rather find it in the United States.  I feel better about the capital that we've got  deployed in Japan than in Taiwan.  I  wish it weren't so, but I think that's the reality.  And I've re-evaluated that  in the light of certain things that were going on."
711,2:12:03,2:12:03,SPEAKER 3, Troy?
712,2:12:04,2:12:07,SPEAKER 7," Well, my view is that Warren ought to feel comfortable if he wants to. "
713,2:12:07,2:12:12,SPEAKER 1, Put that in the minutes.
714,2:12:13,2:12:15,SPEAKER 3," Okay,  station 10.  First of all,  thank you for making our lives better.  My name is Bogumil Baranowski.  I'm a founding partner of Sika's Soshitsu in New York.  We manage multi-generational family fortunes,  hence my question.  Mr.  Buffett,  in 1976,  in your tribute to Benjamin Graham,  you wrote,  Walter Lippman spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit under.  Ben Graham was such a man.  You're both such people.  Could you share with us your 100-year vision for Berkshire?  It's a question to you both.  Yeah, I would like to add one thing about Ben Graham.  Ben Graham did all kinds of things for me,  and he never expected one thing in return.  I mean, just you name it,  and he did it. And there wasn't any hidden, you know, or a hint, I should say, of anything he expected in return. And I  checked—well, he wrote a book in 1949 that, in a sense, said to me in very persuasive terms that what I'd been spending my previous eight or nine years working at and loving was all wrong. And that book has been—I check it every now and then on Amazon to where it ranks, and, you know, Amazon ranks hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of books by sales. And Ben Graham's book has been up there, like, number 300 or 350 or something like that forever. And there isn't any book like that."
715,2:14:22,2:14:31,SPEAKER 1," I wrote  Harper Collins a note the other day,  because they're bringing out another edition.  And I asked them how many copies had been sold,  and they said the records didn't go back  far enough."
716,2:14:33,2:14:48,SPEAKER 5," But they had 7.3 million copies of this little book  that changed my life and continues to outsell every investment book,  and investment books come along, and, you know, they're number 400 or 1"
717,2:14:54,2:14:55,SPEAKER 3,",000 or something for a while,  and then all of a sudden they're numbered 25"
718,2:14:57,2:14:59,BUFFETT,",000 or 200,000.  And this book, you know, in how many areas can you find any book that has had that sustained position?  You can't—you go back and look at number one in 1950 or number two or number three,  and you look at it in 1951 and 1952."
719,2:15:18,2:15:23,SPEAKER 5," They don't continue.  I mean, they just don't continue.  Cookbooks,  maybe one or two of them last for a while,  but there is nothing. And this book lives on, and everybody keeps bringing out new books and saying a lot of other things,  but they aren't saying anything that's as important as what he said in 1949 in this relatively thin little book."
720,2:15:40,2:15:42,BUFFETT," So,  you  know, our vision for Berkshire is exactly what we said today.  We want it to be a company that is owned by its shareholders and behaves in a way that  society is happy that it exists and not unhappy. And we will have unlimited capital."
721,2:16:07,2:16:08,SPEAKER 5," We'll get lots of talent.  And we've got a base that can't be beat. And there's no reason why it can't be perpetuated,  just like Ben's book, and maybe be an example to other people.  And if so, we'll be very happy."
722,2:16:25,2:16:25,SPEAKER 3, Charlie?
723,2:16:27,2:16:40,SPEAKER 7," Yeah, one of the really interesting things about  Ben—he was a really gifted teacher,  a very honorable profession.  And that is what has lasted. "
724,2:16:40,2:16:41,BUFFETT," However,  an interesting fact that he was sheepish about in his old age was that more than half of all the investment return that Ben Graham made in his whole life  came from one stock,  one growth stock, GEICO, Berkshire's subsidiary.  And at the time he operated,  there were a lot of sort of lousy companies that were too cheap,  and you could make a little money floating from one to another.  But the big money he made was one growth stock.  Buying one undervalued great company is a very good thing,  as Berkshire has found out again and again and again. And Ben wrote a postscript to the 49 edition pointing out exactly that fact and acknowledging it,  but also took some good lessons from it.  You know, he said, that's the way life is,  that  you prepare and you don't lose everything along the way, and then something comes along. And GEICO came along because a banker in Fort Worth that had financed Leo Davison—and I think the banker got three-quarters of it,  and I don't mean Leo Davison, Leo Goodwin,  who founded GEICO,  then called Government Employees Insurance Company, and you can figure out the acronym. And the deal almost fell apart."
725,2:18:15,2:18:16,SPEAKER 1," The deal was,  as I remember, maybe a million and a half or something like a million and a quarter. And it almost fell apart because of a difference of $25 ,000 in the net worth delivered."
726,2:18:28,2:18:31,SPEAKER 3, This is a business that's  worth tens of billions.
727,2:18:31,2:18:47,BUFFETT," But he pointed out the irony in that, too.  I mean, he was honest about—he was totally  intellectually honest about his—the failings,  but also the strengths of his approach.  And that to some extent, you know, Charlie and I have seen that in our lives."
728,2:18:53,2:18:56,SPEAKER 5," I mean, sort of the prepared mind,  the willingness to act when you need to act, and the willingness to ignore it—every salesman in the world, and imperative to ignore them. And it's one or two things that make the right decision."
729,2:19:11,2:19:13,SPEAKER 1," If you make the right decision on a spouse, I mean,  you've won the game.  They,  you know—and there's enormous important decision,  and you've got all the time. "
730,2:19:22,2:19:23,SPEAKER 5," I mean,  in the world, you've got more time now than you used to have when I was a kid to make that decision.  And, you know,  I don't know whether a third or whatever percentage below that one,  you know, it is really interesting.  The thing to do is just keep trying to think things through and not do too many stupid things. And  sooner or later, you have a Lollapalooza, as Charlie would say."
731,0:00:02,0:00:03,BUFFETT," Okay,  Becky. "
732,0:00:04,0:00:30,SPEAKER 2," All right, this question comes from Terrafter,  a shareholder in Sierra Vista,  Arizona,  who is asking a question of a Z.  Wants to know about electric vehicles getting insurance from the manufacturer instead of car insurance companies.  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal shows that the EVs are a small but growing percentage of sales.  Tesla and GM are offering their own electric vehicle insurance.  What will GEICO do to combat this? "
733,0:00:33,0:00:33,SPEAKER 10," Yeah,  so GEICO is talking to a number of original equipment manufacturers as well to try and see how best they can  work with the automobile manufacturer and offer insurance at the point of sale.  There haven't been very many success stories yet.  So we'll wait and see."
734,0:00:52,0:00:53,BUFFETT," Clearly,  it is a very convenient way to sell auto insurance at the point of sale.  But  there's a fair amount of data that needs to be collected on the driver,  not just the car.  And that makes it a little more complicated.  So we are talking to some auto manufacturers ourselves.  We are hopeful too that people strike a deal with some of them before not too long.  Tesla has made the end GM.  They both have talked a lot in the press in terms of getting into the insurance business. And in fact, GM I think has projected.  They'll write $3 billion of premium,  which it's hard to imagine where it will come from.  But they're all hot to trot.  I think somebody will find the secret sauce before not too long and we ourselves are in that race.  I would point out that General Motors insurance for decades.  This is not a new idea. And it's...  Uber,  a lot of insurance for a while,  they laid it off with somebody and that company got killed by it.  And I don't know the deal between Uber and forget the name of the company that took it on.  The Jeep would probably know.  But what?  James Schruber.  Yeah.  And you know,  there's nothing. "
735,0:02:19,0:02:20,SPEAKER 4, It's not a new idea.
736,0:02:20,0:02:22,BUFFETT, It's not magic in the lease.
737,0:02:23,0:02:36,SPEAKER 4," I mean, it is hard to come up with something that is better.  And Miss King Mac,  and matching risk to reward.  I'm sorry, risk to price. "
738,0:02:37,0:02:37,BUFFETT," Then a  bunch of very smart people are doing it,  a progressive, and a bunch of very smart people are doing it.  It's a great risk.  I mean,  it is... "
739,0:02:49,0:02:56,SPEAKER 4, It was fascinating to me one Uber went into it.  And they were gonna get their head handed to them.
740,0:02:56,0:02:58,BUFFETT, But they laid it off.  And it was...
741,0:02:58,0:03:03,SPEAKER 4, They laid it off a good bit of it.  Very substantial percentage of it was somebody else who got their head handed to it.
742,0:03:04,0:03:05,BUFFETT, And...
743,0:03:05,0:03:09,SPEAKER 4, But it was a story.  Wall Street loves it.
744,0:03:10,0:03:12,BUFFETT, We've  got 80 car dealerships that do a lot of business.  And...
745,0:03:20,0:03:23,SPEAKER 4, We've got the people buying the car and the place.
746,0:03:24,0:03:25,BUFFETT, And...
747,0:03:25,0:03:34,SPEAKER 4, We form an insurance company around the...  You wrote for some reason that rights insurance...  It's hard to improve on the present system.
748,0:03:36,0:03:36,BUFFETT, Yeah.
749,0:03:36,0:03:42,SPEAKER 4," I have no...  I wouldn't pay a penny.  I'd pay to avoid it, actually. "
750,0:03:42,0:03:43,BUFFETT, I mean...
751,0:03:43,0:03:44,SPEAKER 4," Go ahead, Ajit. "
752,0:03:45,0:03:45,BUFFETT, Yeah.
753,0:03:45,0:03:57,SPEAKER 4," The only point I'd like to add is the bargains on writing auto insurance are 4%,  which is a very small number.  And once there are more people that are trying to take a bite of the apple,  it just becomes very,  very difficult.  It's difficult to keep all the mouths fed in a profitable manner. "
754,0:04:02,0:04:05,BUFFETT," Yeah.  You can say that...  There was one big new idea in insurance...  In car insurance back in 1920 or so,  when State Farm started.  And State Farm... And still has it next to Berkshire.  It's our...  It's the leader in having net worth.  It's a mutual company.  But some guy just figured that there was a cartel...  Well-running car insurance. And he..."
755,0:04:33,0:04:35,SPEAKER 4," Farmer from Murna is the name of the book, I think, and... "
756,0:04:36,0:04:38,BUFFETT, Over in Illinois.  And...
757,0:04:38,0:04:41,SPEAKER 4, He created a system where you really took 20 points or so...
758,0:04:41,0:04:44,BUFFETT, Out of the cost.  And...
759,0:04:44,0:04:45,SPEAKER 4," Surprise, surprise areas.   You know...  And nobody's own stock in State Farm.  It's an insult to capitalism,  actually.  Everything in order that the business school...  Says it shouldn't work."
760,0:04:56,0:04:56,BUFFETT, Because...
761,0:04:57,0:05:10,SPEAKER 4," Nobody owns it.  Nobody's going public with it.  No, nothing.  But it's got more net worth.  It's almost probably double...  Leaving Berkshire out of the picture.  It's probably double the next guy.  And nobody's really improved on their system that much. "
762,0:05:10,0:05:12,BUFFETT, So it's...
763,0:05:13,0:05:16,SPEAKER 4, It's fascinating how...  People don't really look at the essence.
764,0:05:18,0:05:18,BUFFETT, You know...
765,0:05:19,0:05:26,SPEAKER 4," These are cases that...  That should carry a message.  But the truth is in Wall Street,  anything...  The test is whether you can sell it or not.  If you can sell it, it'll get sold. "
766,0:05:33,0:05:33,SPEAKER 5, And...
767,0:05:33,0:05:42,SPEAKER 4, A bunch of insurance companies came along and got it sold.  And this can be a story about this stock or that stock.  It sounded good when they talked about it at Uber for a while.
768,0:05:43,0:05:43,BUFFETT, It is...
769,0:05:44,0:05:47,SPEAKER 4, It is really interesting.  The investing public does not learn much.
770,0:05:47,0:05:50,BUFFETT," Okay,  Station 11.  Hi,  my name is Jeff Merriam.  I'm from Edina, Minnesota.  We've been coming for years to make that professor from the earlier question really nervous.  Half our family's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway."
771,0:06:08,0:06:10,SPEAKER 4," Well, let's make Charlie nervous. "
772,0:06:10,0:06:26,SPEAKER 9," My question has to go with boating control in the future.  There was a question earlier about corporate radar.  I was more wondering about...  Who is actually going to...  Own the voting control.  Is it going to be institutions,  CalPERS,  BlackRock?  Are they eventually going to get their way with the ESG checkboxes that we're going to have to check?  And what should we be thinking about that? "
773,0:06:38,0:06:39,SPEAKER 4," Well, you're thinking very well. "
774,0:06:40,0:06:41,BUFFETT, And...
775,0:06:41,0:06:48,SPEAKER 4," The interesting thing is...  The big aggregations look like,  of course, they'd be in index funds. "
776,0:06:49,0:06:51,BUFFETT, But...  What in their experience?
777,0:06:51,0:07:16,SPEAKER 4," What the funds want is they want a world in which society doesn't get upset with them.  But the fact they've got all the voting power.  And I was saying in the last year or two,  it's looked like a better idea for them, not quite together.  What was the phrase that Charlie used? "
778,0:07:16,0:07:19,BUFFETT, They backed off a lot.
779,0:07:19,0:07:46,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, they backed off a lot.  And it's the narrative to back off.  Interestingly enough,  in looking at money management,  the game is not performance.  It's assets under management.  And index funds produce a tiny, tiny,  tiny fee on assets under management.  Because it was pioneered by Vanguard. "
780,0:07:47,0:07:49,BUFFETT, And...  It's...
781,0:07:49,0:07:51,SPEAKER 5," When it became successful,  it was very easy to replicate.  Not so easy, but I mean, it was inevitable that we copied.  But it came with a management fee of two basis points.  So what people that have offered index funds would really like is you buy their other funds or let them manage money in some other way so that they get a higher...  Higher fee on assets under management.  Which of course is exactly why the index fund was invented in the first place."
782,0:08:23,0:08:24,BUFFETT, But...  So it's gotten...
783,0:08:25,0:08:59,SPEAKER 4," It's not a lost leader.  But it is a way to pull money in.  And then you hope that people ignore what was said by...  What's the name that John Bobo...  Jack Bobo.  Ignore him.  And essentially they give up the idea and that we'll offer you a fund that does this in India.  And we'll offer you another fund that is...  That and of course those management fees are higher.  So they're really counter selling the idea that John Bobo came along with.  But in the process,  they have achieved a lot of boats. "
784,0:09:00,0:09:01,BUFFETT, And...
785,0:09:01,0:09:11,SPEAKER 4," That was fun for a while.  But the last thing in the world I wanted to do is have Washington,  with the American public,  decide that they're going around their way too much. "
786,0:09:12,0:09:12,BUFFETT, So...
787,0:09:12,0:09:18,SPEAKER 4," It's tending to back off.  Now, if you figure out where their self-interest is,  you can judge where their behavior is. "
788,0:09:18,0:09:25,BUFFETT," Where's it going?  Charlie, yeah.  You wanted the fathom?  No, you've been square. "
789,0:09:25,0:09:27,SPEAKER 4, You've just said...
790,0:09:27,0:09:29,BUFFETT, You're totally right on everything.
791,0:09:31,0:09:33,SPEAKER 4," Well, in that case, I won't ask anybody else. "
792,0:09:33,0:09:34,BUFFETT," Okay, Becky. "
793,0:09:35,0:10:23,SPEAKER 2," Alright, this question comes from Almu Grinnell.  And it's about...  This is for Warren and Greg.  Since 2019,  Berkshire repurchased huge amounts of stock about approximately reducing 10% of the share count and increasing the intrinsic value per share for the continuing shareholders.  Greg is expected to be the successor of Warren as CEO.  So will he be in charge of the main capital allocation decisions,  including future share buybacks?  Greg has been key in the development of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and I think a good capital allocator.  Does he...  Has he been involved in the share repurchases that have been executed over the past years?  And do you, both Warren and Greg,  work together in the estimation of Berkshire's intrinsic value and the share buyback decisions? "
794,0:10:24,0:10:35,BUFFETT," Well, the answer is that Greg...  I'm going to turn it over to him,  but the answer is Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do.  And that's looking for us.  And he will make those decisions, I think, very much in the same framework as I would make him.  And we've laid out that framework now for 30 years,  or something like that.  People make it way more complicated than...  I mean, particularly if you're working on a doctorate or something,  it's just a great subject to have lots of footnotes and 50 pages or other pages.  But it's no more complicated than you and I and Charlie had a business and  you wanted to sell your interest and we could buy it for less than we thought it was worth. And without a misleading..."
795,0:11:11,0:11:18,SPEAKER 4," You want any way about what was going on and we'd buy it.  But Greg,  you're on because you're going to be doing it in the future. "
796,0:11:19,0:11:52,BUFFETT," Right?  Yeah, well, I think Warren, you said it really well.  I mean, the framework's been laid out.  We know how you approach it and how you and Charlie have approached it.  And really don't see that framework changing when the opportunity presents itself.  We'll want to be an active repurchaser of Berkshire shares.  We think it's a great outcome for Berkshire.  Sure, sure.  Well, there's a larger piece of each of our operating businesses and the portfolio,  the equity companies,  when the opportunity presents itself. "
797,0:11:52,0:11:56,SPEAKER 4, It can be the dumbest thing you can do or it can be the smartest thing you can do.
798,0:11:56,0:11:57,BUFFETT, And...
799,0:11:57,0:12:51,SPEAKER 4," To make it more complicated than that and start getting into all this...  But you obviously do what the business needs to do first.  The opportunities are there.  Grow your present business,  buy additional business, whatever it may be.  And then you make a decision on dividends but that decision becomes pretty irrevocable because you don't cut dividends without having major effects in your shareholder base and a lot of things.  And then if you've got ample capital and you don't see that you're going to use it all and you're stocked,  it's attractive and it's not a good thing.  It enhances the intrinsic value for the remaining shareholders.  It's an old-brainer and if it's above the price of intrinsic value,  it's an old-brainer that you don't even listen to anybody,  no matter what investment banker comes in and tells you here's how to do a repurchase program. "
800,0:12:52,0:12:52,BUFFETT, Okay.
801,0:12:54,0:12:54,SPEAKER 4, Station one.
802,0:12:54,0:13:30,BUFFETT," I'm Tom Nelson,  a podcaster from North Oaks,  Minnesota.  Charlie,  in 2022,  you used phrases like really massively stupid,  massive kind of ignorance and crazy to describe what you said was the 30% of Americans hesitant to submit themselves to untested mRNA co-op  mRNA COVID gene therapy.  Do you stand behind those quotes today?  Yeah, sure. "
803,0:13:31,0:13:42,SPEAKER 4," Well, we got time for one more than before lunch. "
804,0:13:43,0:13:46,BUFFETT, Becky?  Okay.
805,0:13:47,0:13:50,SPEAKER 2, I thought I was out.
806,0:13:50,0:14:01,BUFFETT," Let's see.  Uh,  how about...  Let's see here.  Uh... "
807,0:14:01,0:14:02,SPEAKER 4," It's gonna be a hob on lunch pretty soon,  but...  No, no, okay.  Let's check that one for you."
808,0:14:04,0:14:23,SPEAKER 2," This one comes from Drew Estes.  This is a question for Warren.  In your 1969 letter to partners,  you said, in any company where the founder and chief driving force behind the Enterprise is still active,  it's still very difficult to evaluate second men.  The only real way to see how someone is going to do when...  when you're in a business,  you're going to be in a business.  When running a company is to let them run it.  This wise statement now applies to Berkshire.  Once the second men are running Berkshire,  what would you advise owners of Berkshire to watch for?  Specifically what actions, if taken,  should give us concern?"
809,0:14:37,0:14:46,SPEAKER 4," Well, I think I would do...  I would have some comfort in the fact that 99% of my net worth is in that company.  So, I probably got a stronger interest in it.   And...  and perhaps 100 billion or more philanthropy will be affected by it."
810,0:14:51,0:14:54,BUFFETT, And...  uh...  But...
811,0:14:55,0:15:10,SPEAKER 4," I would say that I don't have a second choice.  I mean, it is that tough to find,  but I've also seen...  Greg in action that I feel 100% comfortable and...  uh...  uh... And like I say, I don't know...  Something happened to Greg."
812,0:15:17,0:15:18,BUFFETT," I would tell the directors,  you know, they have a problem and they won't...  I  don't have anybody to name and if they put somebody in,  Berkshire on automatic pilot can work extremely well for a long time.  I mean, it doesn't... "
813,0:15:33,0:15:34,SPEAKER 4, It doesn't like the businesses go away or anything.   Sort.  Uh...  And you can't...  It's hard to judge...  successor management... in a really good business.  Because if they...
814,0:15:48,0:15:50,BUFFETT," If they don't show up at the office,  it'll keep working for a long time.  And maybe...  Maybe that..."
815,0:15:55,0:15:58,SPEAKER 4," Black event, useful input...  uh... may show itself in five years..."
816,0:16:00,0:16:09,BUFFETT," I mean, it may go a long, long,  long time.  And...  uh...  How... "
817,0:16:09,0:16:20,SPEAKER 4," How are the shareholders...  you know, advised by a bunch of people that are concerned about whether you're meeting earnings projections or something,  telling them whether the management's any good thing? "
818,0:16:20,0:16:21,BUFFETT," Like,  you know,  it is very, very hard.  It's very hard.  I've been on the board of 20 companies.  It's very hard to...  If you ask me to rank the management of each one... uh...  It's...  uh..."
819,0:16:33,0:16:33,SPEAKER 2, It's...
820,0:16:33,0:16:40,SPEAKER 4, It's very difficult to do because some are just better businesses and others.  Some would be better off not managed hardly at all.
821,0:16:40,0:16:41,BUFFETT, There's...
822,0:16:41,0:16:43,SPEAKER 4, Really need to help.  But they got a lousy business.
823,0:16:44,0:16:46,BUFFETT," And...   Tom Murphy told me a long,  long, long time ago.  He said the secret of businesses to buy...  a good business. And it's okay to inherit one, too.  And Greg is inheriting a good business, and I think it'll make it better.  But I don't think it's easy... to put any one of the next 10 nominees in...  and try and judge three years later whether they've done a good job or not.  So, it's gonna be a... "
824,0:17:09,0:17:16,SPEAKER 4, That'll be a very interesting job for the board.  But it shouldn't listen to Wall Street on it.  They've got the job.
825,0:17:17,0:17:19,BUFFETT, If they put somebody in...
826,0:17:19,0:17:20,SPEAKER 4, There's a surprise.  We both got a job.
827,0:17:20,0:17:22,BUFFETT, I don't know if I put out on a plane that put somebody in.
828,0:17:23,0:17:25,SPEAKER 4, They've got a real job in assessing that person.
829,0:17:25,0:17:27,BUFFETT," It'll depend on...  how good he or she is.  Talker, it'll depend on...  You know...  them courting Wall Street to be supportive of all kinds of things.  And...  uh... "
830,0:17:37,0:17:49,SPEAKER 4, We've got some very good people on the board.  But they would be challenged in that position as would I...  where I've been in that position in other companies where...  a very great leader.
831,0:17:50,0:17:52,BUFFETT," Has left and...  uh...  on the way back from the funeral.  You know, nobody knows what to do exactly. "
832,0:17:57,0:18:02,SPEAKER 4," So with that cheery message,  we will go to lunch.  And we will come back... "
833,0:18:04,0:18:10,BUFFETT, We'll see at one o'clock.
834,0:18:11,0:18:11,SPEAKER 5, Thank you.
835,0:18:11,0:18:13,BUFFETT," And...  we're still gonna try and get 60 questions in.  We've done 25 so far.  Yeah,  25. "
836,0:18:18,0:18:22,SPEAKER 4, So keep the question short and I'll try and get the answer short.
837,0:18:22,0:18:22,BUFFETT, Thanks.
838,0:18:23,0:18:59,SPEAKER 3," Welcome back to our live coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting.  I'm Mike Santoli.  The morning Q&A session has just ended.  Becky will rejoin me in a minute.  But let's recap.  Some of the big news.  Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger,  and Berkshire Vice-Chairs,  Greg Abel and Ajit Jain just made in the Q&A session.  As Warren mentioned, they got through 25 questions. "
839,0:18:59,0:19:00,BUFFETT," Uh...  a lot of them pretty wide ranging at the top.  But it did say that the way things are tracking right now,  most of Berkshire's operating businesses look like they'll be down in earnings for 2023.  So the broader economic slowdown is reaching them.  Broad exposure to railroads."
840,0:19:16,0:19:16,SPEAKER 3," Uh...  and uh...  building products as well as energy.  And a lot of consumer areas.  So that's probably not a surprise,  but it is a contrast to the rise in operating earnings they had in the first quarter.  Now, on Apple,  in response to a shareholder question that Apple was becoming a very large percentage of the investment portfolio,  some 35%, according to the question actually,  it's approaching half of the equity securities in the portfolio.  And Warren Buffett said that's not the way they think about it.  They think about their entire business as being the portfolio.  So Apple is not a particular asset.  It's a relatively large share.  If you consider the companies,  the businesses that they own outright,  and therefore,  he also said Apple is a much better business than any one of their operating businesses.  They wish probably they could own all of it,  but right for now,  they own almost 6%.  Apple keeps buying back a ton of stock,  which raises Berkshire's proportion of the whole company,  which they're pretty happy with at the moment.  Buffett also said in response to a question about how he quickly sold out of Taiwan semiconductor after having built a stake not long before.  Buffett said he feels just his capital is safer in Japan than in Taiwan.  They're a little concerned,  obviously, about geopolitical tensions in Japan.  In Taiwan, excuse me, really does like the investments in the Japanese trading houses financed with very inexpensive borrowings in yen.  So that was essentially some of the headlines out there.  A lot of skeptical comments about AI in response to some questions as to,  we're going to get to a lot of those details.  Meanwhile, cmbc.com's banking reporter Hugh Son at CNBC headquarters right now.  And Hugh, you know, Warren and Charlie didn't spend a whole lot of time this morning talking about the banks.  So despite all the recent regional banking turmoil,  they didn't really get many pointed questions on it,  but did get one.  I wonder what you make of that."
841,0:21:06,0:21:07,BUFFETT, Yeah.
842,0:21:07,0:22:33,SPEAKER 10," So the one question they did.  It was the very first of the day,  which was, you know, what would have happened to,  you know, to the U.S.  if SVB's uninsured depositors were allowed to go under.  And Warren was very clear on that.  He said that he would have led to a disaster that essentially it would have led to a run and every bank in the country,  the following morning.  So essentially an important thing to do.  I think, you know, for my money, it is more interesting about what he hasn't said than what he has,  which is, you know, we're at a moment in this country where,  you know, the business model of regional banking is under a lot of money.  He's retired market is prettyyear all of that into think you know,  we're trying to have this sort of capital policy.  unnecessary profit, we are going to get an explicit key to the loss of GM and the  market, that he has provided capital he has provided confidence to the US banking industry time and time again and so we're all dying really just to figure out what he's going to say.  And you know,  if he doesn't say anything about this,  I would point to the idea that perhaps it is a bit early to get involved in banks I mean he's given pretty negative comments or Becky quick but only last month about his prospects for banking and and that's certainly one of the things I want to hear. "
843,0:22:35,0:23:15,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, for sure and I guess you might also be able to argue that the particular banks that are most under pressure right now are relatively small.  They're literally regional.  They're restricted to small parts of the country.  They're not necessarily big long term franchises that would meet the other investment criteria perhaps that he might look for but it is interesting that he did not really change his holdings in this latest quarter in Bank of America in city group presumably.  So that would suggest that there's not a general condition.  I'm not concerned about the overall system but maybe also at least as far as we know did not find fresh reason to extend capital to some of the struggling banks. "
844,0:23:16,0:23:22,SPEAKER 10," Yeah, I mean, you know, he spent the last three years cutting his stakes banks.  You know, at 1.20, 19,  2018.  He loaded up on JV Morgan Goldman Sachs and had a significant stake in Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo historically had been one of their biggest holdings and he'd paired back after their fake account scandal.  So, and you know, more recently he's paired back in the United States.  He's a big member of the PNC and US Bank Corp. "
845,0:23:36,0:23:37,BUFFETT," So,  certainly I think, you know, the general sort of idea is that he's loath to own banks heading into a potential economic downturn and certainly that's still the case where we are to this day.  Like. "
846,0:23:49,0:24:04,SPEAKER 3," For sure a related area, of course,  this morning, one of the shareholders asked about problems in commercial real estate.  Now, Charlie Munger has been outspoken about the banks being full of what he said were bad loans while he said this morning. "
847,0:24:04,0:24:04,BUFFETT, This would not be a bad loan.
848,0:24:04,0:24:08,SPEAKER 3, This would not be a Berkshire problem.  He is concerned about the situation.  Listen to what he said.
849,0:24:09,0:24:33,BUFFETT," I do think that the howling out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant.  I think country will get through it all right.  But as they say,  it will awfully,  it will often involve a different set of owners.  Yeah,  Mike,  you know, it's a great deal. "
850,0:24:34,0:24:45,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, Mike, you know, that that is one of the sort of feared after effects or exacerbating factors with the regional banking crisis,  of course, is their own exposure to commercial real estate. "
851,0:24:45,0:25:14,SPEAKER 10," Yeah, 100%.  I mean, that would certainly feed into this thesis that maybe now is not the time to come into the banks,  even considering how shellac those stocks have been in instance,  the S.V.B.  collapsed back in March.  Clearly,  you know, the concern right now is that these banks are holding tons of loans either to,  you know, office builders,  commercial real estate loans,  that type of thing,  which are set for some pain in the coming months.  And that has yet to actually play out.  It's certainly something that we're all keeping our eyes on. "
852,0:25:15,0:25:16,BUFFETT, Sure.
853,0:25:17,0:25:22,SPEAKER 3, Also seems some skepticism about the asset class of commercial real estate in general Warren saying that people just essentially pay for the money.
854,0:25:23,0:25:23,BUFFETT," Essentially,  pay for a building,  whatever they can borrow.  So it's not a lot of price discipline there,  perhaps, or valuation focus.  Cute, thanks.  Becky is now back with us.  And, Becky, we hit on a couple of the points."
855,0:25:34,0:25:34,SPEAKER 2, What I miss.
856,0:25:34,0:25:37,SPEAKER 3," Well, I mentioned what he had to say about Apple.   Essentially,  he's not worried about it getting to be too big a position because he views it holistically within the entirety of Berkshire, not just the equity portfolio."
857,0:25:46,0:26:08,SPEAKER 2," You and I had talked about it.  I can't remember if we were on camera when we were discussing this.  But just talking about what a big position it is.  You know, if you don't think about it from his perspective, I hadn't,  just in terms of,  OK, you're not talking about a stock portfolio,  you are talking about an overall portfolio of a company.  And the amount that goes into it.  What kind of stunned me is the idea that he said Apple is a better business than any of the businesses that we own in whole. "
858,0:26:09,0:26:17,SPEAKER 3," Exactly.  Without it, we did mention that that's a big headline.  And, you know, and he said, look, we have great businesses.  We have a great railroad and all the rest of it.  But I think just that's what the numbers would tell you.   Yeah.  And just in terms of the profitability,  the sustainability of profit margins,  the loyal, the sustainability of the customers.  So it was interesting.  He also, you know, he's got a lot of things working in his favor,  which is, as he said, Apple continues to buy back shares from everybody else but him.  Yeah.  And raising his ownership stake in the business."
859,0:26:36,0:26:42,SPEAKER 2," You know, it occurred me at the time.  Maybe we'll get a chance to ask him this at some point.  But if that's the case,  why don't you just put more money in Apple? "
860,0:26:43,0:26:43,BUFFETT," Yeah.   You've got $130 billion on the sitting around in cash.  Obviously, he always wants to have a lot of cash.  She's talked about $50 billion or more in the past.  So that he'll have on hand.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash.  And he's got a lot of cash left in hispping hand."
861,0:26:53,0:26:58,SPEAKER 2, But that still leaves you a lot of wiggle room.  And that makes you think that he must be keeping some of that other dry pattern to be opportunistic.
862,0:26:59,0:26:59,BUFFETT," Yeah, I mean,  it feels like there's a general poll where that in dollar terms,  that position keeps getting bigger.  Yeah. "
863,0:27:05,0:27:12,SPEAKER 3, Apple does well again.  They buy back stock from everybody else.  Let's say it's a much more expensive stock now.  Then it was when he bought it eight years ago.  And maybe that's the explanation. And back then he felt like it was undervalued because people didn't recognize in his view.
864,0:27:16,0:27:16,BUFFETT, Now it was a kind of a indispensable consumer product in the minds of their green Beau.  But it's like you got it.  Yeah.  Love you.
865,0:27:16,0:27:27,SPEAKER 3, People didn't recognize in his view that it was a kind of a indispensable consumer product in the minds of their customers.  Whereas now it's kind of valued the way those other consumer staple businesses are.
866,0:27:27,0:27:30,SPEAKER 2," All right, let's listen to what Warren actually had to say.  We've got those comments about Apple. "
867,0:27:32,0:27:38,SPEAKER 4, Apple has a position with consumers where they're paying.
868,0:27:39,0:27:41,BUFFETT, Maybe they've paid $1
869,0:27:41,0:28:11,SPEAKER 4,",500 or whatever it may be for a phone.  And these same people.  They pay $35,000 for having a second car.  And if they had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone,  they'd give up their second car.  I mean, it's an extraordinary product.  We don't have anything like that,  but we own 100% of.  But we're very, very, very happy to have 5.6 or whatever it may be percent.  And we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up.  That's like having $100 million to earnings. "
870,0:28:12,0:28:12,BUFFETT," I mean,  are sure of the earnings.  And they use their earnings to buy out.  Our partners, which we're glad to see them sell out too.  All  right. "
871,0:28:22,0:28:36,SPEAKER 2," Now right now we want to bring in renowned corporate lawyer and Berkshire director Ron Olson.  Ron is also one of the top shareholders and Berkshire's shares as well.  We keep an eye on a lot of these things.  Ron,  thank you for joining us this morning. "
872,0:28:37,0:28:37,BUFFETT, Hi.
873,0:28:37,0:29:04,SPEAKER 2," We just want to talk to you about what you heard in the first part of this meeting because I think they were pretty reflective.  Pretty focused on a lot of the work that we're doing.  And focused on a lot of the succession issues and what's going to happen,  what's taken place with both Greg Abel and Ajit Jane being in the positions they're in,  maybe stepping up and doing a lot more of the day to day work and activities over the last few years.  As a board member,  the board's been kind of understanding of what's been driving those things.  What do you all talk about in the board meeting? "
874,0:29:05,0:29:06,SPEAKER 3, What do you think of what you've heard today?
875,0:29:07,0:29:07,BUFFETT," Well,  you're right, Becky."
876,0:29:09,0:29:14,SPEAKER 8," There's a lot of focus on succession.  But what I took away from the meeting,  part of which was a lot of work.  The meeting, part of which was not available to the general public,  was what was going on in the movie that preceded it.  There was a focus on succession for over the last three decades,  year after year.  And look what we have on this stage.  What I heard coming from what a combined 101 years from Warren and Charlie was an amazing reflection of the  of their energy and their wisdom.  101 years of business.  Yeah, they made Berkshire, right?  Yeah.  And to me,  they've got a long run way ahead. And we are so fortunate to have Greg Abel designated as Warren's successor and the board feels enormous confidence.  And I can detail a little of that if you want."
877,0:30:08,0:30:09,BUFFETT," But that's,  we've had a lot of contact with Greg.  Personally, I've known him since we bought Mid-America quite a number of years ago."
878,0:30:21,0:30:22,SPEAKER 2, Tiny little company.
879,0:30:23,0:30:28,SPEAKER 8," Had an asset over in the Philippines that generated some energy from geothermal,  a couple other little things. And look what that company is today.  Greg has built that."
880,0:30:36,0:30:37,BUFFETT," Not Warren,  not Charlie. "
881,0:30:38,0:30:39,SPEAKER 8, Greg has built that.   Good bit of it was by acquisition.  And people were waiting for it. And people worry about Greg's ability to make acquisitions.
882,0:30:48,0:30:48,BUFFETT, I don't.
883,0:30:49,0:30:54,SPEAKER 8," The war doesn't.  He's a numbers guy,  just like Warren's a numbers guy. "
884,0:30:55,0:30:55,BUFFETT," I'm not.   They are.  And he has,  you know, the fundamentals.  High integrity, high intelligence recently.  This last year, I got more than what I've had before about Greg by having him as a client.  I worked very closely with him on one matter.  This is a person who leaves nothing for doubt.  He plans. "
885,0:31:23,0:31:24,SPEAKER 2, He's skillful.
886,0:31:25,0:31:32,SPEAKER 8, He has a political skill that I would say exceeds Warren and Charlie's.  So we're very excited.
887,0:31:33,0:31:42,SPEAKER 3," Warren also said that he is a great capital allocator,  which is pretty much a high praise.  As you said, he's done plenty of M&A.  So if you were worried about that part of the business,  but it's interesting.  Because there's always this line that has to be walked,  which is, look, this company is going to be great as structured almost no matter who's running it.  And on top of it,  we have great people who are going to be running it.  Because Warren just said before the break there,  you know, Berkshire on autopilot work extremely well for some period of time. "
888,0:32:00,0:32:01,BUFFETT, Yeah.
889,0:32:01,0:32:04,SPEAKER 8," I think Charlie said slightly differently.  He said,  it's we've given this a lack of attention. And I suggest that that's what the rest of you should do after we leave."
890,0:32:13,0:32:13,BUFFETT, We've got four people.
891,0:32:13,0:32:24,SPEAKER 8," Phenomenal managers.  And so there's a high level of confidence in the future.  And I don't.  I if people didn't take that away from this morning back,  the I'll be surprised."
892,0:32:25,0:32:56,SPEAKER 3," Well, it's also I was going to just mention to the couple of questions about, you know,  once the the shares are,  you know, they've been donated once they convert to class B shares,  the voting control slowly over time.  Eventually we'll make its way out into the public and this seeming concern about what that would mean.  In terms of activists or somebody,  you know, altering the strategy or makeup of the company.  And I, and he warned seem to say nobody could afford to really muscle this company around at this point,  especially in 10 or 15 years. "
893,0:32:56,0:32:57,BUFFETT," Well,  I,  I happen to agree.  I've done a fair amount of work for companies who've been subjected to what we call activists investors through the years,  including some of the names mentioned today.  Um, I don't see.  That being a serious threat in any way, shape or form.  It is a huge company.  Warren pointed out largest net worth in the S and P 500."
894,0:33:26,0:33:28,SPEAKER 2," Uh,  so.  And I think another point to be made in that respect is it's not just Warren and Charlie's holdings of the stock.  We've got shareholders who are devoted to this stock.  And so long as we behave,  they will trust their savings with us. And that's what I wanted to ask you about Ron.  Just the number of items on the ballot this time around on the proxy for ESG for other things they want to push the company to do push the board to do.  Um,  changes whether that be looking at climate change,  whether that be saying I'm not going to ever have anyone at the company have a political perspective that's made public.  I mean, those are things that, that have been a very important thing.  I mean, I think that Warren and Charlie both have been pretty disdainful of the idea that anybody else gets to force all the rest of the shareholders and the rest of the company what to do.  And that's fine because Warren and Charlie are in a position to be able to say those things.  I think the key is probably the shareholder base.  Are you convinced that the shareholder base will remain the same and second of all,  will they vote?  Will they actually go out and vote because retail investors in general don't vote on these things.  They just let it ride,  which is why you can have somebody get out of the way.  They get a small portion of the vote and have their way with it. "
895,0:34:48,0:35:11,SPEAKER 8," Well, the increasing percentage of ownership by some of the large index funds and so on.  Yes, that's a different kind of investment,  but I don't see that overtaking the individual shareholders that have been our base for years. "
896,0:35:12,0:35:12,SPEAKER 2, They're confidence.
897,0:35:12,0:35:12,BUFFETT, I think that's a big deal.
898,0:35:12,0:35:13,SPEAKER 2," Their confidence,  I think, will remain as long as we have the kind of leadership we've had.  And Greg's not going to change that.  These managers are not going to disappear.  If we make other acquisitions,  I've got confidence.  We will and I've got confidence that they will be made soundly with leadership that Warren has said for years,  the kind of leadership that love their money or love their business more than they love their business.  They love their money and they'll be devoted to what is in the best interest of these individual shareholders."
899,0:35:49,0:35:49,BUFFETT," So,  you take these four initiatives.  Climate change is a big issue.  No question about it. And by the way, I thought Warren's comment today about one more thing as a country should be thinking about is how we're going to mobilize the dedication to climate change.  As we did mobilize the country in defending World War II or  pursuing World War II.  And there's a lot that can be done,  but I don't think very many companies have done more than Berkshire.  And I don't think the people that are pushing these initiatives really understand what the monies we are devoting to.  For instance, transmission building,  which is essential to get renewable energy where it needs to be.  You know, what Greg has done out in Iowa building pasty for nearly 100% of the rate payers is great."
900,0:36:54,0:37:03,SPEAKER 2," Ron, one last question before you go.  Is there something you're hoping to hear more about in the second round of Q&A?  Is there something you're hoping to hear in the second round of Q&A? "
901,0:37:03,0:37:04,SPEAKER 8, You mean this afternoon?
902,0:37:05,0:37:05,BUFFETT, Yeah.
903,0:37:05,0:37:44,SPEAKER 8," I don't have any great,  I don't think there's a need for the  meat filling in the blanks for what they're going to say.  But there is a seriousness of purpose about this meeting that simply is not reflected in any other meeting,  annual meeting I go to,  and I go to a number.  And that comes about,  I think, because of the mutual respect between the audience.  That is the shareholders and the management.  And I want to see that content in the next round of Q&A.  I'm sure it will this afternoon. "
904,0:37:44,0:37:48,SPEAKER 2," Ron Olson,  who is a Berkshire board member,  want to thank you so much for your time today Ron. "
905,0:37:48,0:37:50,SPEAKER 8, I'm delighted to be here.
906,0:37:50,0:37:51,SPEAKER 2, It's great to see you.  Thank you.
907,0:37:52,0:37:52,BUFFETT, Thanks Ron.
908,0:37:53,0:38:06,SPEAKER 3," It is AI, of course, is all the rage right now with recent earnings calls flooded with references.  One of the shareholders wanted to get warrant and Charlie's thoughts,  not surprisingly Charlie Munger did not hold back. "
909,0:38:06,0:38:17,BUFFETT, I am personally skeptical of some of the hype.  This is going into artificial intelligence.  I think old fashioned intelligence works pretty well.
910,0:38:17,0:38:23,SPEAKER 4," It can do all kinds of things.  And when something can do all kinds of things,  I get a little bit worried. And because I know we won't be able to un-invent it."
911,0:38:30,0:38:32,BUFFETT," And, you know,  we did invent for a very,  very good reason they had a bomb in World War II.  And it was enormously important that we did so.  But this is good for the next 200 years of the world.  The ability to do so has been unleashed.  We didn't have any choice.  But when you start something,  well Einstein said after that a bomb,  he said, this has changed everything in the world except how men think. And I  would say, the same thing may not not the same thing.  I don't mean that,  but I mean, with with AI,  it  can change everything in the world except.  Oh, men think it behave."
912,0:39:30,0:39:41,SPEAKER 3, Joining us now is noted tech investor Ann Windblad.  She's co-founder and managing partner of Hummer Wind by Venture Partners.  And it's great to see you.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for stopping by here.
913,0:39:41,0:39:41,BUFFETT," Um, "
914,0:00:00,0:00:04,BUFFETT," I've been getting reports,  we're breaking all kinds of records,  and we're going to start  off with question number 26,  which goes to station 2."
915,0:00:21,0:00:40,SPEAKER 1," Hi,  Warren and Chalice.  My name is James,  from Leisure.  Given the reason, challenged,  faced by the major US bank,  what is your overall  outlook on the banking industry?  How do you assess the risks and the opportunity in this section?  Well,  anticipating a few questions on banks,  I decided we should start using bank language here.  I'll describe to you.  And Charlie."
916,0:00:57,0:01:16,BUFFETT," The situation in banking is,  is very similar to what it's always been in banking, that fear is contagious, always. And historically,  sometimes the fear was justified.  And sometimes it wasn't my dad lost his job in 1931 because of a bank run. And they had a bank run on state banks. And they had the online loan on national banks that were in the national bank and they didn't ever run on the national banks.  And of course, they both faced the same problem.  So it used to be that if you saw people lining up at a bank,  the proper response was to get into the line.  And you'd always leave it. And the story is that Sydney Wyberke of Goldman Sachs during one of the great bank runs, I get 90% of the bank runs."
917,0:02:15,0:02:16,SPEAKER 3," In 1907 or thereabouts,  how do jobs are run or Goldman Sachs and asked if it was if he could take the week off. And it was said sure not much is going on anyway.  So he got in line that whether it was a liquor barker truster or wherever. And as he got toward the front of the line, he sold his place in line to somebody.  He didn't have an account of the bank,  but that was an asset.  And the banking system, the banking system has changed so much over the years.  And we did something enormously sensible in my view.  When we set up the FDIC,  as many as 2000 banks have failed in one year back after World War I."
918,0:03:02,0:03:06,SPEAKER 2," I mean, bank runs were just part of the picture.  And if you have people that are worried about whether their money is safe in the bank and all fine would rise,  you can't run on the economy very well."
919,0:03:14,0:03:15,SPEAKER 1," So, that's what I do. "
920,0:03:15,0:03:18,SPEAKER 3, The FDIC was very logical.  It's got changed over the years some.
921,0:03:19,0:03:42,BUFFETT," But here we are in,  you know, 2023.  And we actually see the FDIC pay off 100 cents on the dollar to everybody or make it available on all the men in the puzzles.  And yet you still have people very worried about  their, the periodic, the money. And it's been very, very quickly geographically, all kinds of crazy ways. And that just shouldn't happen."
922,0:03:51,0:03:51,SPEAKER 2," So,  the message has been very poor.  It's been poor by the politicians who sometimes have an interest in having it poor.  It's been poor by the agencies.  And I'd say it's been poor by the press.  I mean, you shouldn't have so many people that misunderstand the fact that although there may be a debt ceiling, you know, you know, you have to be able to get the money."
923,0:04:14,0:04:15,BUFFETT, There may be a debt ceiling.
924,0:04:16,0:04:17,SPEAKER 2, It's going to get changed.
925,0:04:18,0:04:19,SPEAKER 5, Although there's a $250
926,0:04:19,0:04:49,SPEAKER 2,",000 limit on FDIC,  the FDIC and the US government and American public have no interest in having a  bank fail and have deposits actually lost by people.  We had a demonstration project the weekend of Silicon Valley Bank and the public is still confused.  So, it's really interesting.  It's something to have a law that was passed in 19th,  or a law that became effective in 1934,  or modified in some way.  Not understood about something as important as the banking system. "
927,0:04:57,0:04:59,SPEAKER 3," I don't think the American public is that dumb.  And I just, well, I made that offer over in Tokyo incidentally that I haven't heard from anybody that wants to take up my million dollar bet on  whether the public will lose money.  And if  they have a demand deposit at a bank, no matter what the size.  So, that's the world we live in.  It means that a lot of magic can turn into a conflagration,  or it can be blown out.  And who knows what will happen?  And we don't have any worry.  We keep our money into cash and trades, you both at Berkshire, because we keep a hundred. 28 billion or whatever was at the end of the quarter. And we want to be there if the banking system temporarily even gets stalled in some way.  It shouldn't.  I don't think it will,  but I think it could.  And I think that the incentives in bank regulation are so messed up.  And so many people have an interest in having a messed up.  It's totally crazy.  I mean, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were doing 40 or so percent of the mortgage business in the United States."
928,0:06:22,0:06:23,SPEAKER 1, That is huge.
929,0:06:24,0:06:24,SPEAKER 2, They were regulated.
930,0:06:26,0:06:31,SPEAKER 1," Just those two companies were regulated by some group,  I forget what they called, but they had 150 people that were in charge of just figuring out whether Freddie and Fannie were going to get it.  Right thing, but I could have done it."
931,0:06:42,0:06:43,SPEAKER 2, Charlie could have done it.
932,0:06:44,0:06:48,BUFFETT," I'm not sure they needed an assistant even to do it,  but the incentives were all wrong. And Freddie and Fannie,  which we're doing fine in August,  we're apparently going fine in July and August of 2008,  were put into conservatorship early in September. And the things that followed from that were just incredible."
933,0:07:07,0:07:07,SPEAKER 1," So,  there are second order and third order. And then, we're going to get it."
934,0:07:10,0:07:19,BUFFETT," Third order and fourth order effects that are somewhat unpredictable as to what they will be and the sequence and all that, but things change.  And if people think deposits are sticky anymore, they're just living in a different era.  You know, press a button."
935,0:07:31,0:07:44,SPEAKER 3," You don't have to get in a line and wait for days and have the teller counting out the money slowly and gold.  So, that you hope the line goes away.  You can have a run in a few seconds. "
936,0:07:45,0:07:45,BUFFETT," So,  the way it hasn't been addressed properly is a problem.  And who knows where it leads.  But you will have to have a punishment for the people that do the wrong thing.  And if you take first Republic, for example,  you could look at their terms.  You could look at their 10k and you could see that they were offering non-government guaranteed mortgages to jumble amounts at fixed rates,  sometimes for 10 years before they changed the floating. And that's a crazy proposition."
937,0:08:31,0:08:33,SPEAKER 2," If it's to the advantage of the bank,  they get it.  They get the guy coming in and says, I'll read for.  Finance at one and a half percent and then one percent.  And if it's, that's the advantage the other way,  the fellow keeps it out of 10 years."
938,0:08:47,0:09:07,SPEAKER 1, You don't give options like that.  But that's what the first Republic was doing.  It was a plain sight.  And the world ignored it until it blew up.  And some of the stock in some of these banks that were held by Insider was a soul.  And who knows?
939,0:09:09,0:09:17,SPEAKER 2," Whether they had a plan or whether they,  some plan that was innocent or whether they started sensing what was coming. "
940,0:09:17,0:09:17,SPEAKER 1," But,  but you do know that the directors are not going to be able to read some book or anything like that.  But they do,  they do have the ability to hold the CEO accountable."
941,0:09:35,0:09:36,SPEAKER 3," The CEO gets,  gets the bank in trouble both the CEO and the director should suffer."
942,0:09:40,0:09:43,SPEAKER 5, The stockholders of the future shouldn't suffer.
943,0:09:43,0:09:44,SPEAKER 3, They didn't do anything.
944,0:09:44,0:09:50,SPEAKER 1," It doesn't teach anybody any lessons or anything.  It teaches the lesson is that if you run a bank and you screw it up,  you still live with, you're still a rich guy and the clubs don't drop you and,  and the charity groups aren't asking it to their benefits.  The world goes on. "
945,0:10:00,0:10:04,SPEAKER 2, That is not a good lesson to teach people who are.
946,0:10:05,0:10:05,SPEAKER 1," Holding the  behavior of the economy in their hands.  So I think there's some work to be done, but I don't think it's, it's not a difficult problem.  It's just we've screwed up the answer and we screwed up the communication of it.  Charlie. "
947,0:10:18,0:10:31,SPEAKER 2," Well, I'm so old fashioned that I kind of liked it better when banks didn't do investment banking.  That makes me very outmoded in the modern world.  And the country decided it was good.  The country had a public interest for a while and then then the banks wanted to get back into it."
948,0:10:39,0:10:40,BUFFETT, Did they ever?
949,0:10:41,0:10:41,SPEAKER 2," No,  I mean, I don't think having a bunch of bankers,  all of them were trying to get rich leads to good things.  But I think a banker should be more like an engineer.  He's more like avoiding trouble and he is getting rich."
950,0:10:57,0:10:58,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, and they could do fine. "
951,0:10:58,0:11:04,BUFFETT, They can do fine that way.  And I think we're going to be mistaken.  We've got a bank where everybody who joins us funds.
952,0:11:05,0:11:05,SPEAKER 2, We get rich.
953,0:11:06,0:11:09,SPEAKER 3, It's a contradiction in values.  And we came to that conclusion.
954,0:11:10,0:11:15,SPEAKER 1," I don't know when glass  steel was passed or anything,  but then they want to get back in. "
955,0:11:16,0:11:18,SPEAKER 3," How many of you know,  and maybe I'm rolling on this happen. "
956,0:11:18,0:11:19,SPEAKER 1, Look lately.
957,0:11:20,0:11:57,SPEAKER 3," But the Federal Reserve actually was given the responsibility  for setting margin requirements.  And they changed margin requirements a lot of times because it  was known that people that borrow a lot of money cause the danger to the bank system.  You get too many in the picture and all of that sort of thing.  And what's happened?  The banks figured out a thousand different ways to get so you borrow on a hundred percent margin.  I mean, through derivatives and everything,  they just totally distorted all the lessons that were learned in the 29 crash. "
958,0:11:57,0:12:02,BUFFETT, Imagine taking banking into derivative trading.  Who in his right mind would have allowed that?
959,0:12:04,0:12:05,SPEAKER 2," Well, there's more money in it. "
960,0:12:06,0:12:07,BUFFETT," Well, that's why they're in it.   Yeah.  And but it isn't necessarily a great social outcome for the rest of us."
961,0:12:14,0:12:18,SPEAKER 1," That's what that's what those Senate committees decided back in 1931 and 32.  And then in the late 1990s,  particularly, I mean, you know, very decent people, but you know, Bob Roman and some of the people,  you know, they they said, this is the modern world.  And here's what the modern world is turned out to hand us.  And I think that's what the last time we've done, and the late 1990s, particularly, I mean, you know, very decent people, but you know, Bob Roman and some of the people, you know, they said,  this is the modern world. And here's what the modern world is turned out to hand us and banking banking can have all kinds of of new inventions.  But it needs to have old values. And well, if we don't have that,  we don't have that good economy,  but we can't be able to have that kind of economy in that kind of way.  And the way that we have that kind of economy in the world."
962,0:12:48,0:12:57,SPEAKER 2," Well, if we don't know what's going to happen,  you know, because there are a lot of things that could happen out of the present situation. "
963,0:12:57,0:12:59,SPEAKER 3," Depositors will not lose money.   Stockholders and deadholders of the holding company,  no, they should lose money. And the people borrowed on commercial real estate. And now it isn't the loans aren't getting extended."
964,0:13:12,0:13:14,BUFFETT, They should leave too bad.
965,0:13:14,0:13:17,SPEAKER 2," I mean, that's part of borrowing on 100% margin,  which is what people are doing.  I've been doing it in commercial real estate.   You've got to have the penalties hit the people to cause the problems.  And if they took risks that they shouldn't have it,  it needs to fall on them if you're going to change how people are going to behave in the future."
966,0:13:36,0:13:41,SPEAKER 1," Okay, Becky. "
967,0:13:41,0:13:41,SPEAKER 9," This  question comes from Davis Hanson in Houston, Texas.  He writes, what do you think about the business models of the big banks as compared to the regional banks in the wake of the events at Silicon Valley Bank?  And how does the perceived implicit guarantee of all deposits at all banks affect big banks and those regional banks? "
968,0:14:01,0:14:01,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, well,  I can  say this.  If you follow sound banking methods,  which means you're not doing something else, I mean, you're not doing some things that other people do."
969,0:14:13,0:14:40,SPEAKER 2," Bank could be a perfectly decent investment.  In fact, Charlie and I was me originally in 1969.  We bought a bank at Berkshire and we had $19 million invested in that bank.  And we had $17 million,  I think, invested in our insurance companies.  And if the banking holding company act of 1970 hadn't been passed,  we might have ended up owning a lot of banks instead of a lot of insurance companies.   We were looking at more banks and Harry Keith was taking us around Chicago and there were other things we could do.  And then bingo, they passed the 1970 bank holding company act and we had to divest ourselves of that bank in 10 years, which, by the way, it never had a bad death.  It never had an unnecessary cost.  It made nothing but money with no risk.  It never presented any deposit insurance risk to the government.  Zero. "
970,0:15:08,0:15:16,SPEAKER 3, It was a lovely sound.  Constructive institution in this community and any person who already deserved credit could get credit.  And we were going to buy more banks.
971,0:15:17,0:15:18,SPEAKER 1," We were forced out of it.  And we were going to buy more banks. And if we bought more banks, we probably wouldn't have expanded the insurance business.  But, you know, the law changed and so we divested and we've done all kind of insurance."
972,0:15:29,0:15:31,BUFFETT, But banking was more attractive to us.
973,0:15:32,0:15:40,SPEAKER 5," It was bigger than there were more targets to buy.  And you could run a perfectly simple business.  And you could sell them down bank then. And no negotiable service ever gets to do all these things, all the inventions that came later.  And you could sell them today and you could earn a lot.  You could earn good money,  very good money.  And we would have found more banks.  But we're precluded from doing that and we sold banks,  bank stocks in the last,  well, we sold them first when the bank is.  The pandemic broke out and then we sold some more in the last six months.  And we don't know where the shareholders of the big banks necessarily or the regional banks or any are heading."
974,0:16:25,0:16:26,SPEAKER 3, I've got my bank.
975,0:16:26,0:16:29,SPEAKER 2, I've got my own personal money and I'm probably above the
976,0:16:30,0:16:30,SPEAKER 3," FDIC limit.   I've got it with a local bank.  And I think I don't worry about it in the least.  But in terms of owning banks,  even if you're not going to get a little  advanced, we'll determine their future. And you've got politicians involved."
977,0:16:47,0:17:24,SPEAKER 1," You've got a whole lot of people don't really understand how the system works.  And I would say that you've had something less than a perfect communication between various people and the American public.  So the American public is probably as confused about banking as ever.  And that has consequences.  And nobody knows what the consequences are because every event starts recreating a different dynamic.  I mean, in physics, you know that Pi is going to be 3.14,  you know, infinite number of numbers after that.  But no matter what happens,  but you don't know what has happened to the stickiness of deposits."
978,0:17:36,0:17:38,SPEAKER 3, So all they got changed by 2008.   It's gotten changed by this.  And that changes everything. And so we're very cautious in a situation like that about ownership of banks. And we do remain with one bank holding a deal.
979,0:18:00,0:18:13,SPEAKER 2," But we originated that deal.  And with the Bank of America,  and I like Bank of America,  I like the bank.  I like the management and I propose the deal with them. "
980,0:18:13,0:18:14,SPEAKER 3, So I stick with it.
981,0:18:15,0:18:40,SPEAKER 2," But do I know how to project out what's going to happen for me?  The answer is I don't because I've seen so many things in the last few months,  which really weren't that unexpected to me to see,  but which reconfirm, I believe, that the American public doesn't understand their banking system.  And some people in Congress perhaps don't understand it anymore.  I don't understand what the spaceships go up. "
982,0:18:40,0:18:42,BUFFETT," I mean, there's all kinds of things I don't know about. "
983,0:18:43,0:18:57,SPEAKER 2," But if you're in Congress,  you take a position on everything.  And sometimes it's your advantage.  If you really understand it,  not to say exactly what you feel.  And here we are.  Charlie, yeah. "
984,0:18:57,0:19:15,BUFFETT," Well, a lot has happened in the bank in my lifetime.  I welcomed all that early banking of the  deserving immigrants by the early Bank of America.  And I think all the credit cards when they came in as  original bank cards were great contributions of civilization. "
985,0:19:18,0:19:21,SPEAKER 3," But the game here gets,  and the more it looks like investment banking,  the less I like it as a citizen.  I don't want I am always I  am deeply distrustful situation,  so which everybody wants to get rich and envious everybody else.  I regard that atmosphere as utterly toxic. And the people like one story, which is,  again, a true story and I'm not naming the name.  And it wasn't Pete Jeffers because he might fit this."
986,0:19:55,0:19:56,BUFFETT," Name it, it wasn't Pete.   But our hero, Jean A.  Begg, was going to have to retire at some point.  And so we we hired a future replacement."
987,0:20:08,0:20:11,SPEAKER 3, It's kind of a little problem I talked before about having the perfect business.
988,0:20:11,0:20:12,BUFFETT, Now we're going to bring in somebody.
989,0:20:13,0:20:14,SPEAKER 2, We actually bring in some money.
990,0:20:15,0:20:17,SPEAKER 3, They want this central high with Charlie.   Yeah.  And Charlie didn't know I was picking out this guy.  He wasn't.
991,0:20:23,0:20:24,BUFFETT," If he'd ask me,  we wouldn't have hired him. "
992,0:20:25,0:20:52,SPEAKER 3," Well, I asked you I probably wouldn't hire anybody,  but that's another question.  But this guy comes over a perfectly decent guy,  but presentable, you know, it looks like a banker and everything.  And of course, the first thing he wants to do,  we've got this wonderful bank,  but we have the crumbiest looking building in Rockford.  And we don't need a great building.  We just need a great banker and natural.  This guy wants to build a new building. "
993,0:20:52,0:20:53,SPEAKER 2, And.
994,0:20:53,0:20:59,SPEAKER 3," Because we were the most profitable bank,  but we didn't look like we were the most profitable bank. "
995,0:20:59,0:21:09,SPEAKER 2," So I told him he could have any building you wanted as long as it was not higher than that to be shorter than our nearest competitor.  And he.  He lost interest totally.  He wanted to be on the top floor of the biggest building in town. And I told him he'd get horizontally do anything he wanted,  but he couldn't do it vertically."
996,0:21:23,0:21:26,SPEAKER 3," It taught me a lot about the guys motivations in life,  but and he didn't end up running the bank anyway."
997,0:21:29,0:21:29,SPEAKER 2," Anyway,  that's all I know about banking, probably more."
998,0:21:32,0:21:34,BUFFETT, Station three.
999,0:21:36,0:22:56,SPEAKER 1," Mr.  Buffett and Mr.  Munger.  Hi,  my name is Daphne.  I'm 13 years old,  and this is my six annual Berkshire halfway ten shoulders meeting.  And I've had the privilege of being here.  I've had the privilege to ask you both questions in years past.  My question for you today is the following.  As you know,  the US national debt is currently at an estimated $31 trillion,  making up about 125% of the US GDP.  In the meantime,  over the past few years,  the Federal Reserve has telegraphed that they intend to monetize the debt by printing trillions of dollars.  Even as they insist that they're fighting in fact,  they're going to be able to do it.  And I'm going to ask you about the inflation.  Already other major economies in the world, such as China,  Saudi Arabia,  and Brazil are moving away from the dollar and anticipation of this.  My question is,  are we likely to face a time in the future when the US dollar is no longer the global reserve currency?  How is Berkshire prepared for this possibility?  And what can we do as American citizens to attempt to shelter ourselves from what's beginning to look like?  The beginnings of the dollarization?  Well,  I should ask you to come up here and answer some questions.  It's very interesting."
1000,0:23:12,0:23:12,SPEAKER 2," I mean,  we are the reserve currency.  I see no option for any other currency to be the reserve currency. And I think that I'm sure you're not going to be able to do that.  Nobody understands the situation better than Jay Powell.  But he's not in control of fiscal policy.  And every now and then he drops a few hints.  And there was no question that when the pandemic broke out,  I mean, it was a semi-warlike situation.  But nobody knows what's going on.  Nobody knows how far you can go with the paper currency before it gets out of control.  And particularly if you're the world's reserve currency, nobody knows the answer to that. And you don't want to try and pick out the point that it does become a problem because then it's all over. And I think we should be very careful."
1001,0:24:20,0:24:21,SPEAKER 1," I mean, you know, we all learned that we're going to be able to do that. "
1002,0:24:21,0:24:27,SPEAKER 2," You know, we all learned Keynesianism and we applied in World War II to the advantage of the country.  And we did everything.  We could to prevent inflation during the war and then war ended in August of 45.  And I think in January,  46, and I'm not giving you exact figures at all now,  but in January, 46, I think the rate of inflation was at something like 1% or thereabouts.  And by the end of the year,  I think it was at like 15% and again, I'm.  Doing this from long memories, but it's easy for America to do us a lot."
1003,0:25:05,0:25:06,BUFFETT," But if we do too much,  it's very hard to see how you recover once you let the genie out of the bottle and people lose faith in the currency.  And they'd be.  They behave in an entirely different manner than they do when they feel that they put someone in the bank or have a pension plan or whatever it may be that they're going to get out of something with roughly equal purchasing power.  And it just changes the economy and all kinds of things can happen then. And I can't predict them and nobody else can predict."
1004,0:25:42,0:25:49,SPEAKER 3, But I do know they aren't good and we will see.  And I do this as.
1005,0:25:49,0:25:50,SPEAKER 1," You know, I. "
1006,0:25:51,0:25:59,SPEAKER 3, I voted for both parties and it's it's it's not limited to politicians to be the party or anything of the sort.
1007,0:25:59,0:26:03,BUFFETT," People take positions,  some will understand what they're doing,  some don't understand what they're doing.  And you know, if they put me on.  Some medical board, I don't understand what I'm doing."
1008,0:26:14,0:26:14,SPEAKER 1," You know,  it's not that there's nothing wrong with the fact that you.  That."
1009,0:26:19,0:26:21,SPEAKER 3, You can't.  Master.
1010,0:26:21,0:26:29,SPEAKER 2," Everything can all be Isaac Newton,  but you can't go around pretending to do or making decisions on it.  And and we.   Are not as well off in relations to curving inflation expectations,  which become self fulfilling.  And we are not as well off as we were earlier and Berkshire.  Is better prepared than most investments for that kind of a period."
1011,0:26:48,0:26:49,BUFFETT," I said this in the annual report,  but we aren't perfectly prepared.  Because there's no there's no way to perfectly prepare.  You don't know what course of action will occur and.  It's a very political decision now is to tribal the citizens of some degree.  And. "
1012,0:27:06,0:27:12,SPEAKER 3, You'll hope for leadership that that's actually.
1013,0:27:14,0:27:17,SPEAKER 2, We'll do something recognizes the problem and.
1014,0:27:18,0:27:23,BUFFETT," America's an incredible society, rich.  You know, we got everything going for us,  but that doesn't mean we can just print money indefinitely."
1015,0:27:27,0:27:34,SPEAKER 2," But.  As that and.  It'll be interesting to see how it turns out, Charlie. "
1016,0:27:35,0:27:42,BUFFETT," Well, at some point.  Printing money to buy votes will be counterproductive.   Yeah.  And we don't we don't know exactly where that comes.  And if something is going to be.  Dangerous and unproductive, you are to keep it a fair distance away.  Now, if you have a culture that is exceptionally strong, like Japan.  They have done some strange things there, but they couldn't have been the reserve currency.  No, of course not.  And but Japan bought back.  Most of the national data,  most of the common stocks and. "
1017,0:28:15,0:28:15,SPEAKER 2, Dead.
1018,0:28:15,0:28:34,BUFFETT," Just the Federal Reserve on the.  Everything in Japan and the country's working.  It's in 30 years of economic status,  but it's not going to help.  I really admired Japan.  And but I don't think we should try and imitate it.  I don't think we're as good as Japan at taking. "
1019,0:28:35,0:28:38,SPEAKER 3," They have a cohesive culture and we don't,  Charlie."
1020,0:28:39,0:28:48,BUFFETT," That's exactly right.  In Japan, everybody's supposed to suck up and cope and.  In America, we're going to have to.  America, we can play. "
1021,0:28:49,0:28:55,SPEAKER 3, So I hope you come next year with a tougher question.  And thank you. And I predict.  I would love to be being born again today in the United States.
1022,0:29:04,0:29:04,SPEAKER 2," I mean,  we."
1023,0:29:05,0:29:13,SPEAKER 3, We can do a we can do a lot of them things and get away with it.  We can't do an unlimited number.  There are people who care about that.
1024,0:29:14,0:29:14,SPEAKER 1, And.
1025,0:29:15,0:29:15,BUFFETT, You know.
1026,0:29:17,0:29:23,SPEAKER 3," You have to be willing to be.  Extraordinarily unpopular.  I mean,  Paul Volker. "
1027,0:29:24,0:29:25,SPEAKER 1, There are.
1028,0:29:25,0:29:27,SPEAKER 5, There are other Federal Reserve.
1029,0:29:28,0:29:30,BUFFETT, Here are people that would not have.
1030,0:29:31,0:29:32,SPEAKER 1, Not have done what they did.  It's just.
1031,0:29:33,0:29:35,SPEAKER 2, It's too uncomfortable and.
1032,0:29:36,0:29:40,SPEAKER 3," There used to be a politician in Nebraska.  And if you ask them some really tough question like, you know, how do you stand on abortion or.  He would look you right in the eye and say, I'm all right on that one and then he moved next."
1033,0:29:50,0:29:50,SPEAKER 2," Well,  that's what people have done."
1034,0:29:51,0:29:53,BUFFETT, Basically on inflation.
1035,0:29:53,0:29:54,SPEAKER 1, And.
1036,0:29:54,0:29:54,SPEAKER 2, They.
1037,0:29:55,0:29:56,SPEAKER 1, One way or another.   They.  They say I'm all right on that.  And then they.
1038,0:30:00,0:30:01,SPEAKER 2, They don't really think about.
1039,0:30:02,0:30:04,BUFFETT, What the consequences of their actions could be.
1040,0:30:05,0:30:05,SPEAKER 2, Particularly.  And it's so much fun.
1041,0:30:07,0:30:13,SPEAKER 3, There's four hundred and thirty five of you to just be one of one hundred thirty five instead of being the person actually responsible.
1042,0:30:14,0:30:14,SPEAKER 2, Anyway.
1043,0:30:15,0:30:16,SPEAKER 3, I am still.
1044,0:30:18,0:30:19,BUFFETT, Next to the.
1045,0:30:20,0:30:24,SPEAKER 2, Question of two superpowers and when you get into really destroying a planet.
1046,0:30:25,0:30:26,SPEAKER 1, Destroying.
1047,0:30:27,0:30:33,SPEAKER 2, The reserve currency of the world when there's really no sub and forget about all the toys.
1048,0:30:33,0:30:34,SPEAKER 1," You know, with.  With. "
1049,0:30:35,0:30:36,SPEAKER 3," I mean, it's a joke. "
1050,0:30:37,0:30:38,SPEAKER 2, To think of any.
1051,0:30:39,0:30:39,SPEAKER 5, Tokums or.
1052,0:30:40,0:30:42,SPEAKER 3, That sort of that.
1053,0:30:42,0:30:43,SPEAKER 1, That's.
1054,0:30:43,0:30:44,BUFFETT, That's madness.
1055,0:30:44,0:30:52,SPEAKER 2," But.  It's also madness.  To just keep printing money.  Yeah.  And.  We know how to do it.  And we actually came from a money printing economy.  In world or two, which was required.  And we suffered significant place in the price level.  I mean, there are a million ways to judge it.   But maybe ten times what it was.  And or something like that."
1056,0:31:09,0:31:11,SPEAKER 1," Well, that's.  That's getting close to the edge. "
1057,0:31:12,0:31:13,SPEAKER 2, Where you don't want to.
1058,0:31:13,0:31:15,SPEAKER 1, You don't want to hold.
1059,0:31:15,0:31:17,SPEAKER 2, The other thing.  We want to hold something else.
1060,0:31:17,0:31:19,SPEAKER 1, I want to hold real estate.
1061,0:31:19,0:31:21,SPEAKER 2, You want to hold an interest in a business.
1062,0:31:21,0:31:22,BUFFETT, There's a lot of good.
1063,0:31:22,0:31:23,SPEAKER 1, Your best.
1064,0:31:23,0:31:24,SPEAKER 3, Your best.
1065,0:31:25,0:31:27,SPEAKER 2, Defense is your own earning power.
1066,0:31:28,0:31:30,SPEAKER 3," If you're the best doctor in town,  if you're the best lawyer in town,  if you're the best teacher in town, or even if you're the tenth best or 10.  You're going to make a good living.  I mean, the economy is productive  and you will succeed with your talents.  But you won't succeed by hoarding dollars."
1067,0:31:47,0:31:48,SPEAKER 1, You'll just be.
1068,0:31:49,0:31:55,SPEAKER 2," You'll just succeed by the fact that you're.  You're valued of the community,  which is a rich community overall.   It's sustained.  And so the best investment is always in yourself."
1069,0:32:00,0:32:01,SPEAKER 3, That's the answer I would give you.
1070,0:32:02,0:32:13,BUFFETT," Well, we have a situation where we've learned to print money.  In gobs and.  Little big chunk of our young people go right into wealth management. "
1071,0:32:15,0:32:16,SPEAKER 5, This is like we did.
1072,0:32:17,0:32:19,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, like we did. "
1073,0:32:19,0:32:31,BUFFETT," Yes, we've been bad examples.  And I want to say that I didn't realize wealth management was going to get so big when I went into it.  And I apologize for what's happened. "
1074,0:32:32,0:32:33,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  Well.
1075,0:32:34,0:32:36,BUFFETT," Anyway, you did well. "
1076,0:32:37,0:32:37,SPEAKER 2, Becky.
1077,0:32:38,0:33:08,SPEAKER 9," This question comes from Gary Gambino in Parma,  Ohio, who says he's been a Berkshire shareholder since 2000.  He says the amount paid this year for the 41.4% stake in pilot values the entire company at around $19 billion.  That's about six times what BP is paying for travel centers of America.  But pilots market share is just three times travel centers of Americas.  Was it a big mistake to base the final price on 2022 earnings,  which has unusually high fuel margins? "
1078,0:33:09,0:33:20,SPEAKER 3," Well, that's a very good question.  The answer is.  That we arranged a buy it in three stages.  With the third stage being at the option of these.  Owner of 20%. "
1079,0:33:20,0:33:20,SPEAKER 2, The  first stage we.
1080,0:33:22,0:33:54,SPEAKER 3," We bought it what turned out to be a very attractive price.  The second stage turned out to be a very good year for the diesel.  Business, which means that the seller got a very good price.  And I would say that overall we feel very good about the fact we only 80% as the price that we do.  But we would have rather own.  We just bought the 80% the price.  We just start with and the last 20%,  the seller has the option and that's always an unintelligent way of structuring something. "
1081,0:33:54,0:33:56,SPEAKER 2, We've had that arrangement with other.
1082,0:33:57,0:34:05,SPEAKER 3," Well, we've had it with the furniture mark.  We bought 80% of the furniture mark on August 30th,  1983, almost 40 years ago and it's worked out perfectly. "
1083,0:34:06,0:34:06,SPEAKER 1, But.
1084,0:34:06,0:34:09,BUFFETT," When you give the other person the option,  they've got some advantage.  We have 80% now of a business we like very much.  And the company has a lot of money.  And the comparison travel America is really.  Spurious because travel America.  Not only much smaller,  but they run all the problems.  We have hundreds and hundreds of locations on the interstate.  There are zone for what we.  Commercial."
1085,0:34:33,0:34:34,SPEAKER 1," They can.  Maybe.  15 acres or.  There's nothing like it.  And they're not going to move the interstate two miles to the right or something.  And then you know,  it was sort.  So."
1086,0:34:43,0:34:45,SPEAKER 3, We've got a position that.
1087,0:34:45,0:34:46,SPEAKER 2, That.
1088,0:34:47,0:34:55,SPEAKER 3," You know, BP may or may not have made a fine deal.  I've read the perspective.  And I can understand. "
1089,0:34:55,0:34:57,SPEAKER 1," I mean, it's a big.  The big source of. "
1090,0:34:58,0:34:59,SPEAKER 3, Output for for BP.
1091,0:35:00,0:35:00,SPEAKER 2, But.
1092,0:35:01,0:35:01,BUFFETT, I like.
1093,0:35:02,0:35:03,SPEAKER 2, I like the management.
1094,0:35:03,0:35:04,BUFFETT, We have had at the.
1095,0:35:05,0:35:05,SPEAKER 2, At.
1096,0:35:07,0:35:08,SPEAKER 1, At.  At.  Pilot.
1097,0:35:08,0:35:11,SPEAKER 2, I like very much.  The fellow is coming in.
1098,0:35:12,0:35:14,SPEAKER 3, That's a new CEO.
1099,0:35:15,0:35:19,SPEAKER 2," I just have to tell you a little bit about Adam right,  who's taking that job on."
1100,0:35:21,0:35:23,SPEAKER 1, He came from Omaha.
1101,0:35:23,0:35:28,SPEAKER 3, He wasn't selected because he came from Omaha.  He came from Omaha.  He came from North.
1102,0:35:28,0:35:28,SPEAKER 1, I that.
1103,0:35:29,0:35:30,BUFFETT, A public school that.
1104,0:35:31,0:35:32,SPEAKER 3, My wife graduated from.
1105,0:35:32,0:35:33,SPEAKER 2, I've got.
1106,0:35:34,0:35:36,BUFFETT, Grandchildren that graduated from there.
1107,0:35:36,0:35:38,SPEAKER 2, He went to the University of Nebraska.
1108,0:35:38,0:35:39,BUFFETT," Almost set the rushing record.  And football, but you'll never be beaten because they've given up football."
1109,0:35:43,0:35:44,SPEAKER 3," But I think he rushed for maybe.  3600.  He held three jobs.  Well, he went through there.  He interned. "
1110,0:35:51,0:35:55,SPEAKER 2," Mid-American 20 years ago,  his mother worked to put him to a school. "
1111,0:35:55,0:35:56,SPEAKER 5," I mean, it's just it's a ratio. "
1112,0:35:57,0:35:57,SPEAKER 3, Algier squared.  And we have him the.  The managed pilot and.
1113,0:36:03,0:36:03,SPEAKER 1, The.
1114,0:36:03,0:36:05,SPEAKER 2, Have.  Give us a wonderful business.
1115,0:36:05,0:36:07,SPEAKER 1, Big Jim.  And he.
1116,0:36:09,0:36:09,SPEAKER 2, He.
1117,0:36:10,0:36:10,SPEAKER 3," My vintage.   I mean,  great people. And here we are."
1118,0:36:14,0:36:17,SPEAKER 2, Uh.  And I'm glad I'm very glad we own pilot.
1119,0:36:17,0:36:20,SPEAKER 3, I just wish we bought 100% percent.
1120,0:36:20,0:36:22,SPEAKER 2," I first made the deal,  but that was not the deal."
1121,0:36:23,0:36:24,BUFFETT, Or I wasn't for sale.
1122,0:36:24,0:36:25,SPEAKER 3, It wasn't for sale.
1123,0:36:26,0:36:26,SPEAKER 2," Yeah.  And and then suddenly we the last 20% of.  Of the furniture Mart wasn't for sale when we bought.  So we bought 80% of it.  And that's worked out well.  And and we've done various deals, various ways."
1124,0:36:40,0:36:42,SPEAKER 3, The best way to do it is just write people to check.  And and get the stock was.
1125,0:36:45,0:36:45,SPEAKER 2, We'd.
1126,0:36:45,0:36:46,SPEAKER 1," Did that with TGI,  but but you can't always make the same deal.  We make. "
1127,0:36:50,0:36:54,SPEAKER 2, If we like the business well enough and the people well enough.  We.
1128,0:36:54,0:37:02,SPEAKER 3," We will tailor it differently,  but our preference is to write a check on the whole place and.  And keep the management in place. "
1129,0:37:02,0:37:05,SPEAKER 1, I don't know.
1130,0:37:05,0:37:12,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.  I hope.  It's really wonderful to watch something like Adam.
1131,0:37:13,0:37:13,SPEAKER 3, Right work out.
1132,0:37:14,0:37:14,SPEAKER 1," I mean, basically,  you know, I don't know what.  There's a mother was earning, but but.  You went to North High, which is."
1133,0:37:22,0:37:25,SPEAKER 2, Probably four or five miles from here.  Public school graduate.  And worked his way up.
1134,0:37:29,0:37:32,SPEAKER 5, Went for a short period of Pacific.
1135,0:37:33,0:37:43,SPEAKER 2," Gas and electric and we brought him home.  They're on pilot and pilot.  Well, pilot. "
1136,0:37:43,0:37:49,SPEAKER 3, The prices on diesel were way different.  I should pop pilot close to 80 billion of sale last year.
1137,0:37:50,0:37:50,SPEAKER 2," But.   More normal prices.  It's.  It's significant.  And you know, it's half that or thereabouts."
1138,0:37:57,0:37:59,SPEAKER 1, Maybe a little more.  But.
1139,0:38:00,0:38:00,SPEAKER 2, He is.
1140,0:38:01,0:38:02,SPEAKER 1, I don't know how.
1141,0:38:02,0:38:03,SPEAKER 3, How that would be.
1142,0:38:05,0:38:05,SPEAKER 1,But since 40. And he came up through.
1143,0:38:07,0:38:10,SPEAKER 2, He came up through the organization that.   Greg able to involve with.  And now here is.  Running a very major business.
1144,0:38:16,0:38:17,SPEAKER 1, It's good.
1145,0:38:18,0:38:19,SPEAKER 3, I'd prefer to be able to.
1146,0:38:20,0:38:24,SPEAKER 1, Do that.  And.  I don't know.
1147,0:38:25,0:38:26,SPEAKER 3, Somebody else may have gone to.
1148,0:38:26,0:38:30,SPEAKER 1, More prestigious.  Business schools.  So what.
1149,0:38:30,0:38:33,SPEAKER 3, We've seen what Adam can do.
1150,0:38:33,0:38:34,SPEAKER 2, Okay.
1151,0:38:35,0:38:36,BUFFETT, Station for.

1155,0:38:43,0:39:01,SPEAKER 7," My name is JC.  I'm 15 years old and I'm from Ohio.  This is my fourth in person.  Berkshire meeting.  I have a lot of passion learning from your speeches,  interviews and articles.  Thank you for sharing your wisdom all the time.  Mr. "
1156,0:39:01,0:39:01,SPEAKER 1, Buffett.
1157,0:39:02,0:39:29,SPEAKER 7, In your annual shareholder letter this year.  You said that Berkshire's journey consisted.  Of continuous savings.  The power of conounding.  The American tailwind.  And avoidance of major mistakes.  You have humbly admitted.  In the past.  That you have made many.  Mistakes.  But this is the first time that major mistakes.  Sit out to me.  Could you please advise us on what major mistakes.
1158,0:39:29,0:39:30,SPEAKER 1, We should learn.
1159,0:39:30,0:39:35,SPEAKER 7, We should avoid.  In both investing.  And in life.  I would also like to have.
1160,0:39:36,0:39:36,SPEAKER 2, Mr.
1161,0:39:36,0:39:39,SPEAKER 7, Munger's thoughts to please.  Thank you very much.
1162,0:39:39,0:39:40,SPEAKER 1," Well, let me. "
1163,0:39:42,0:39:47,SPEAKER 3, Charlie Charlie said the major mistake you make.
1164,0:39:47,0:39:49,SPEAKER 1, Then you know you're you're lucky.
1165,0:39:49,0:39:50,BUFFETT, You're in the United States.
1166,0:39:50,0:39:52,SPEAKER 1, Go around the world.
1167,0:39:52,0:39:54,BUFFETT, You don't have a lot of choices in some places.
1168,0:39:54,0:39:54,SPEAKER 1, But.
1169,0:39:55,0:39:55,SPEAKER 2, But.
1170,0:39:56,0:40:00,SPEAKER 3, You should write your obituary and try and figure out how to live up to it.
1171,0:40:00,0:40:01,SPEAKER 1, And.
1172,0:40:02,0:40:06,SPEAKER 3, You know that's.  That's something you get wiser on.
1173,0:40:07,0:40:07,SPEAKER 2, There's you.
1174,0:40:08,0:40:10,SPEAKER 3, Go along.
1175,0:40:10,0:40:11,BUFFETT, The business mistakes.
1176,0:40:12,0:40:23,SPEAKER 3," You just want to make sure you don't make any mistakes to take you out of the game or come close to taking out of your game.  You should never have a night when you're.  Worried about investing.  I mean, so many have any money to invest at all. "
1177,0:40:23,0:40:25,SPEAKER 1, You should.  You should.
1178,0:40:25,0:40:46,SPEAKER 3," It's just spend a little bit less than your earn and you can spend a little bit more than your earn and then then you've got that and the chances are you'll never get out of that.  I'll make an exception in terms of.  Of a mortgage on your house, but but.  Credit card debt and when the credit card business big time and what will say in the credit card business, but.  Why get behind the game and. "
1179,0:40:47,0:40:48,SPEAKER 2, If you're.
1180,0:40:48,0:40:56,SPEAKER 3," Effectively.  Paying 12 or 14 or whatever percent you're paying on a credit card.  You know, you're saying I'm going to earn more than 14% of money and. "
1181,0:40:57,0:40:57,SPEAKER 1, You can do that.
1182,0:40:57,0:40:58,SPEAKER 3, Come to Berkshire Hathaway.
1183,0:40:59,0:40:59,SPEAKER 1, So.
1184,0:40:59,0:40:59,SPEAKER 2, It.
1185,0:41:00,0:41:02,SPEAKER 1, It.  It's.
1186,0:41:03,0:41:04,SPEAKER 3, I hate to say this with Charlie's around.
1187,0:41:05,0:41:05,SPEAKER 1, But  it's straight out of Ben Franklin.
1188,0:41:07,0:41:08,SPEAKER 2, And.
1189,0:41:10,0:41:11,SPEAKER 5, It's not.
1190,0:41:12,0:41:13,SPEAKER 3, It's not.
1191,0:41:14,0:41:17,SPEAKER 1, It's not that complicated.  But.
1192,0:41:18,0:41:18,SPEAKER 2, Uh.
1193,0:41:20,0:41:20,SPEAKER 1, You.
1194,0:41:21,0:41:26,SPEAKER 3," Well, I'll give you a couple lessons on you know.  Tom Murphy, the first time I met him. "
1195,0:41:26,0:41:29,BUFFETT," Said two things to me, said, you know,  always tell someone to go to help tomorrow."
1196,0:41:31,0:41:44,SPEAKER 3," Well, that was great advice then.  And think of what great advice it is when you.  When you sit down at the computer and screw your life on forever.  By telling somebody to go to help or something else in 30 seconds and you can't erase it. "
1197,0:41:45,0:41:45,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1198,0:41:46,0:41:46,SPEAKER 2, And.
1199,0:41:47,0:41:48,BUFFETT," You know, you haven't lost the option. "
1200,0:41:48,0:41:48,SPEAKER 2," You know, you can't raise it. "
1201,0:41:48,0:41:49,SPEAKER 1," Uh.  And.  You know, you haven't lost the option.  You know, I don't want to make it.  You know, you're there.  I want to make it.  You know, it's not.  You've got to be.  You know, you've got to be.  You know, you've got to be.  You know, I think it's worth it.  You don't want to be.  You've got to be.  You've got to be. "
1202,0:41:49,0:41:49,SPEAKER 2, You've got to be.
1203,0:41:49,0:41:54,SPEAKER 3," You know, and then and he said, you know,  praise, praise my name criticized by category. "
1204,0:41:54,0:41:59,SPEAKER 2," Well, what makes more sense than that?  I mean, who do you like to criticize you all the time?  And uh."
1205,0:42:01,0:42:02,SPEAKER 1, You don't need to.
1206,0:42:02,0:42:10,SPEAKER 3, You don't need to vilify anybody to make your point on on on on subject to discussion and and uh.  And then they give another general piece of advice.
1207,0:42:14,0:42:17,SPEAKER 2, I've I've never known anybody that was basically kind.
1208,0:42:18,0:42:18,SPEAKER 1," The diagon.  I've never known anybody that was basically kind.  The diagon.  I've never known anybody that was basically  something that I think.  The diagon without friends and uh, I've known many people with money that died without friends, uh, including their family and uh,  but I've never known anybody and and uh."
1209,0:42:31,0:42:33,SPEAKER 2," You know,  I've seen a few people,  including Tom Murphy, senior and  maybe junior who's here but certainly his dad.  Uh, hey, I never saw him.  I watched him for 50 years."
1210,0:42:43,0:42:44,SPEAKER 1, I never saw him do.  And unkind act I didn't.
1211,0:42:46,0:42:48,SPEAKER 3, I didn't seem to do very many stupid acts.
1212,0:42:48,0:42:48,SPEAKER 1," You know, I've never seen that.  But I never saw him in fact.  I don't want to do that.  I was.  I never.  I was in fact.  I would have seen him.  I'm not even just.  I can't do anything.  But I never.  I was in fact.  I never saw him.  I should have seen him.  I was in fact.  I was in fact.  And I never saw him.  I was in fact.  I never saw him.  I never saw him do.  And I'm kinda act. "
1213,0:42:48,0:42:48,SPEAKER 2, I don't want to be in the city.
1214,0:42:48,0:42:48,SPEAKER 1, I don't want to be in the city.  I just want to be in the city.  I just want to be in the city.  It was not comfortable to see you either.
1215,0:42:48,0:42:50,SPEAKER 3," I mean, it wasn't he was not discriminating. "
1216,0:42:50,0:42:56,SPEAKER 1, He just he just he just decided that that there's no reason to do it.  And uh.
1217,0:42:58,0:42:59,SPEAKER 3," Wow, what a different set makes in the lives. "
1218,0:43:00,0:43:00,SPEAKER 1, Charlie.
1219,0:43:02,0:43:05,BUFFETT," Well, it's.  It's so simple. "
1220,0:43:05,0:43:06,SPEAKER 2, Do.
1221,0:43:07,0:43:12,BUFFETT," Spend less than you earn and in  the city.  You know, you're trying to keep learning all your life, etc, etc.  And do a lot of deferred gratification because you prefer life that way.  And if you do all those things,  you are almost certain to succeed.  And if you don't,  you're going to need a lot of luck.  A lot of luck.  And you don't want to need a lot of luck.  You want to go into a game where you're very likely to win without having any unusual luck. "
1222,0:43:46,0:43:47,SPEAKER 3, I'd add one more thought to.
1223,0:43:47,0:43:47,SPEAKER 1, I'd.
1224,0:43:48,0:43:54,SPEAKER 3, You need to know how people can manipulate other people than you need to resist the temptation to do it yourself.
1225,0:43:55,0:43:55,SPEAKER 2," Oh, yes. "
1226,0:43:55,0:43:55,SPEAKER 1, The.
1227,0:43:57,0:44:10,BUFFETT, The toxic people.  Who are trying to fool you or lie to you who aren't reliable meeting their commitments.  A great lesson of life is get the mail out of your life.
1228,0:44:10,0:44:10,SPEAKER 3, Yep.  And do it fast.  Do it fast. And I would add.  But Charlie wouldn't agree with me to attack fully a possible tube.  But do get about it in your life.
1229,0:44:29,0:44:39,BUFFETT," Yes.  Yeah, I don't mind a little tact.  Or even a little financial cost.  But the question is getting in my hell out of the law. "
1230,0:44:40,0:44:40,SPEAKER 2, Okay.
1231,0:44:41,0:44:41,SPEAKER 1, Becky.
1232,0:44:42,0:45:11,SPEAKER 9," All right, this comes from Roger Lee Tan.  He says, my name is Roger from Hong Kong,  a long term shareholder of Berkshire admirer and follower of Mr.  Buffett's and Munger's wisdom and principle.  Both of you have said before that the most difficult problems in life are always people problems.  And one of the key lessons you have learned to be able to live a happy life and a successful life is to stay away from negative people.  My question is what to do if those negative people are your families. "
1233,0:45:12,0:45:12,SPEAKER 1, The people.
1234,0:45:13,0:45:15,SPEAKER 9, Who you can't simply stay away from.
1235,0:45:15,0:45:15,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.
1236,0:45:16,0:45:18,SPEAKER 3, You minimize it.
1237,0:45:18,0:45:20,SPEAKER 2, But you can't know that.
1238,0:45:20,0:45:22,SPEAKER 1," I mean, there's no question about it. "
1239,0:45:22,0:45:25,SPEAKER 3, Charlie Gevon add.  So I thought was a master of tact.
1240,0:45:25,0:45:26,SPEAKER 1," The other day when he says,  you always ought to interact with people to behave well.  And so of course,  you have to make some exceptions to your family."
1241,0:45:33,0:45:35,SPEAKER 2," But it was.   But it's true.  And you know, you really."
1242,0:45:40,0:45:46,SPEAKER 3," I don't know what it's like to have, you know,  a."
1243,0:45:48,0:45:50,SPEAKER 1," Drunken,  you know,  bullish."
1244,0:45:53,0:45:57,SPEAKER 3, Probably father but parent just generally.
1245,0:45:58,0:45:58,SPEAKER 1," I mean, you  know, how do you handle it?"
1246,0:46:01,0:46:06,BUFFETT, It's very interesting that the MacArthur family.
1247,0:46:07,0:46:11,SPEAKER 3," Very famous John MacArthur,  the man who set up the MacArthur Foundation. "
1248,0:46:12,0:46:17,BUFFETT, He had five kids and four of them turned out to be.
1249,0:46:18,0:46:36,SPEAKER 3," Superstars of one sort or another and they had this crazy.  I general drunken father,  but they all decided the thing to do was get the hell out of the house.  And so, yeah, this.  The father of the father of the father of the foundation that did that along with three of the siblings. "
1250,0:46:36,0:46:37,SPEAKER 2," Five.  So,  you know, I I  was lucky.  I mean,  Charlie was lucky.  And it.  You  know, if you.  If you have a.  I mean, our father saw probably of shortcomings and.  And both of us.  But, you know, it would still be there for us.  And if you have one that won't be there for you, you know, it's a very tough problem. And I think one way or another.  I probably would have gotten through with that."
1251,0:47:13,0:47:18,SPEAKER 3, That if I had that situation.  But I don't think I think my life.
1252,0:47:18,0:47:19,SPEAKER 1, Would have been a lot different.  Charlie.
1253,0:47:22,0:47:23,BUFFETT, I have nothing to add.
1254,0:47:23,0:47:26,SPEAKER 2, We're.  We're.  Okay.
1255,0:47:26,0:47:27,BUFFETT, Station five.
1256,0:47:28,0:48:30,SPEAKER 1," Hey Warren and Charlie.  Good afternoon.  My name is Sudaka Reddy and I'm ready.  I'm from Bentonville, Arkansas,  home of Walmart.  I'm here.  Share older since 2019 and my daughters are share older since 2020.  My question is.  This is my first time coming to share older's and my question is.  Walmart and Berkshire Hathaway has very great relationship.  With BNSF,  McLean and consumer goods like fruit of the looms and  granumels and etcetera.  My question is,  granumels is exclusively sold at Walmart and fruit of the loom is sold at many other retailers.  How does Berkshire Hathaway decides some items are sold at some retailers exclusively versus others sold at many retailers?  Well, that's a good question. "
1257,0:48:30,0:48:45,SPEAKER 3," But obviously, you'd love to control if you have a product,  you'd love to control the distribution and you're probably going to get better gross margins if they ask for you by name.  I mean, they just had an article about Bernard. "
1258,0:48:45,0:48:47,SPEAKER 1," Oh, oh.  Oh. "
1259,0:48:48,0:48:48,SPEAKER 3," Well, the M. "
1260,0:48:49,0:48:50,SPEAKER 2," H and you know,  he's got a blue box of Tiffany and the blue box itself means something and Coca-Cola bottle met something in the 1920s.  I think there was a study of that kind of."
1261,0:49:01,0:49:02,SPEAKER 1, Sure.
1262,0:49:02,0:49:10,SPEAKER 3, Bottle and blindfolded very high percentage of the population could recognize it was Coca-Cola one thing and recognize not only the.
1263,0:49:10,0:49:12,SPEAKER 2, The product was a container.
1264,0:49:13,0:49:17,BUFFETT," You know, you're going to have good growth margins and if you're just another "
1265,0:49:17,0:49:30,SPEAKER 2," Coca-Cola and there've been hundreds of them and even if you have distribution to something like Walmart who has Sam's Coca-Cola,  it just doesn't. "
1266,0:49:30,0:49:31,SPEAKER 3, It's not the same.
1267,0:49:31,0:49:32,SPEAKER 2," I mean, here I am.   You know,  and 1886 or so John Pemberton in Atlanta.  Crater didn't they they spent very significant amount of money advertising on the other hand."
1268,0:49:46,0:49:47,SPEAKER 5, Hershey's didn't spend any money on it.  And then it was just a little bit more of an advertising.
1269,0:49:48,0:49:54,SPEAKER 2," So.  We have observed Charlie and I both have observed so many products,  so many methods of retail and we really think.  We know quite a bit about it and we also know how much we don't know about it.  It's the same time and it doesn't mean that we want to go into retailing ourselves,  but it does mean we've learned to some extent what to avoid.  And we've learned when somebody really has some of the other things that we've learned.  And I think that's something.  Granum was had something.  It's just that there's only many. "
1270,0:50:22,0:50:22,SPEAKER 1," You know,  Walmart does a great job of distribution for us and it's a good product for Walmart."
1271,0:50:29,0:50:30,BUFFETT, It's a good product for us.
1272,0:50:31,0:50:31,SPEAKER 2, And.
1273,0:50:32,0:50:33,SPEAKER 1, On through the loom.
1274,0:50:34,0:50:41,SPEAKER 3," They can sell lots of types of underwear and they can do a big volume,  but we're not going to make as much money.  We'll also believe to capital employed or anything with a product that that has a whole bunch of competitors and if the kid wants to go around and will be amazon or something.  It's not it's not the sort of product that causes people to drive 20 miles out of their way to buy it or anything of the sort.  But if you're in the Walmart and you're picking up a jam is or something for the kid and and.  Here she wants.   A particular product.  And  it's not it's reasonably priced and everything and and wears well."
1275,0:51:20,0:51:27,SPEAKER 2," You know, we will.  We're happy to have a distributed through somebody with a distribution power of Walmart and their design. "
1276,0:51:28,0:51:29,SPEAKER 3, They're very happy to have the product.
1277,0:51:30,0:51:33,BUFFETT, Unbalance is obviously better.
1278,0:51:34,0:51:40,SPEAKER 2," If you own sees candy than if you own the no name candy company.  You know, particularly when the. "
1279,0:51:41,0:51:43,SPEAKER 3, People buy it as gifts a couple times a year.
1280,0:51:44,0:51:44,SPEAKER 1," I mean, they. "
1281,0:51:44,0:51:46,SPEAKER 3, Know that if they give.
1282,0:51:46,0:51:47,SPEAKER 2, If they give.
1283,0:51:47,0:51:59,SPEAKER 3, Their girlfriend if they give someone in the hospital if they give a gift to.  Christmas or going to a dinner.  They know what they hand the box of candy to somebody.
1284,0:51:59,0:52:01,SPEAKER 2, They don't say at the same time here.
1285,0:52:01,0:52:10,SPEAKER 3," I got a wonderful deal on this candy.  I mean, it kills the moment, right?  But they really want to see a smile on the other person's face that they're receiving it and they get it. "
1286,0:52:11,0:52:14,SPEAKER 1, So.  Knowing what.
1287,0:52:15,0:52:20,SPEAKER 3, Custom and.  See box chocolate.  They are not  remotely the market that soft drinks are.
1288,0:52:23,0:52:25,SPEAKER 1, And.
1289,0:52:26,0:52:28,BUFFETT, The product.  Does not travel particularly.
1290,0:52:29,0:52:30,SPEAKER 2, Hersey's chocolate and travel.
1291,0:52:31,0:52:31,SPEAKER 1," I mean,  if you look at candy bars.  What's popular in the UK isn't that popular in the US and all kinds of things."
1292,0:52:37,0:52:39,BUFFETT, Cola travels.
1293,0:52:40,0:52:46,SPEAKER 2, There's 200 countries and roughly and probably 180 of them.  It's the number of products and.
1294,0:52:48,0:52:48,SPEAKER 1, How do you do it?
1295,0:52:49,0:52:49,SPEAKER 2," Well,  helps if you started in 1886 and go from that point forward.  So we've learned a lot. "
1296,0:52:57,0:52:58,SPEAKER 5, We got a lot to learn.
1297,0:52:59,0:53:00,SPEAKER 1, But.  We did learn.
1298,0:53:01,0:53:03,SPEAKER 2, Something like or animals.
1299,0:53:03,0:53:07,SPEAKER 1," We understood.  When it came around,  nobody ever heard of it.  We bought.  We're. "
1300,0:53:08,0:53:09,SPEAKER 3, Very low price.
1301,0:53:09,0:53:10,SPEAKER 1, Turned out in.
1302,0:53:11,0:53:18,SPEAKER 2," Twenty years ago and still nobody knows.  We own it.  That's fine, but they know what corannimals are. "
1303,0:53:18,0:53:18,SPEAKER 3, And.  And it has legs.
1304,0:53:21,0:53:21,SPEAKER 2, It keeps.
1305,0:53:22,0:53:24,BUFFETT, It just keeps going year after year and some.
1306,0:53:24,0:53:28,SPEAKER 2, Some things are like pet rocks and.  And we're running all the time.
1307,0:53:30,0:53:30,SPEAKER 1, Trying.
1308,0:53:32,0:53:33,SPEAKER 2, I  have nothing bad.  I'll.
1309,0:53:37,0:53:40,SPEAKER 3, You probably never want to go round.
1310,0:53:40,0:53:40,SPEAKER 2," No,  I never."
1311,0:53:41,0:53:44,BUFFETT, I don't even wear them.
1312,0:53:45,0:53:44,SPEAKER 1, It wasn't.
1313,0:00:00,0:00:02,BUFFETT," Okay, Becky. "
1314,0:00:03,0:00:29,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from Barry Laffer in New York City.  Berkshire owns about 94 million shares of Paramount Global as of the last published data.  This asset rich company is disappointed on recent quarterly earnings reports in just this week,  slashed its dividend by 80%.  How do you see the streaming wars evolving and do you still have conviction in your investment thesis?  Is your investment thesis based on the company being an acquisition target or  based on its fundamentals? "
1315,0:00:30,0:00:30,BUFFETT," Yeah,  and how would you like to manage my money for nothing?"
1316,0:00:34,0:00:45,SPEAKER 3, We are not in the business of giving stock advice to people and people who don't know what anybody stocks can make a lot of money doing that.
1317,0:00:45,0:00:48,BUFFETT, We don't think it's something we should give away.
1318,0:00:50,0:01:11,SPEAKER 3," But I will say it's not good news when any company passes a dividend or cuts a dividend dramatically.  And the streaming businesses,  extremely interesting to watch because there's people love to use their eyeballs watching being entertained on a screen in front of them or a phone or whatever it may be. "
1319,0:01:11,0:01:20,SPEAKER 4, But there's a lot of companies doing it and you need fewer companies or you need higher prices.
1320,0:01:20,0:01:22,SPEAKER 3," Well, you need higher prices.  It doesn't work.  And you don't lock in people when you get them to join up for the dividend.  The streaming period when your cereal runs, you keep them on for a while."
1321,0:01:33,0:01:34,BUFFETT," But you can lock them up.  And we'll see what happens.  I mean,  I had a gasoline station.  When it was 21 or 22,  when there's about three or four miles from here. And we had one competitor. And he determined our profit because we lived in his price every day.  If we cut the price,  he'd match it. And we couldn't raise the price. And he did twice the gallon."
1322,0:02:06,0:02:07,SPEAKER 6, So he won.  And there's just basic business problems that you see with certain interest.  You don't see what the other Disney was unique. And it's animated what it offered in the 30s and 40s. And they wrote the stuff off. And the first showing. And then they.
1323,0:02:28,0:02:34,SPEAKER 8, They rejuvenated Snow White and all these other people every seven years.  And that was fine.
1324,0:02:36,0:02:38,SPEAKER 6, But this is a different world.  And the eyeballs aren't going to increase dramatically. And the time they can spend it's not going to increase dramatically. And you got to buy.
1325,0:02:47,0:02:59,BUFFETT, Which is companies that don't want to quit.  And who knows what pricing does under that.  But anybody tells you what they know what pricing will do in the future.  As is getting themselves.
1326,0:02:59,0:03:00,SPEAKER 6, Charlie.
1327,0:03:01,0:03:03,SPEAKER 8, Charlie's had a lot of experience since not with Hollywood.
1328,0:03:03,0:03:05,SPEAKER 3," I mean, he used to before I even met him. "
1329,0:03:07,0:03:10,SPEAKER 4, I think the movie business is one tough business.
1330,0:03:10,0:03:10,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.
1331,0:03:10,0:03:11,SPEAKER 4, That's my view.
1332,0:03:11,0:03:12,BUFFETT, The talent will make the money.
1333,0:03:13,0:03:24,SPEAKER 3," The agents will make the money.  And if you've got a theater,  you know, the theaters are now doing 70% of the business that they did before  the pandemic and big hits.   You know, you have enormous grosses,  but you can't reduce the supply.  People have only got so many so many hours in the day, they've only got two eyeballs and they got more choice than ever before. And they've got such a cheaper that offers them the same experience and some of them like experience.  You know, particularly the big hits of going But  it isn't like you can double the number of people or double the eyeballs or anything like that.  And and you're getting some sort of the you've got a lot of people the talent will always get paid and when you essentially are packaging  the talent one way or another and you need to get higher prices and you've got a lot of strong  companies that don't want to quit.  That's an interesting an interesting equation."
1334,0:04:15,0:04:27,SPEAKER 4," Hey, if you think the movies are tough,  try to invest in a New York show on a conventional  POPWETLife 3 Full Conference launched in 2008 this year financial stage there they think it's a breach of faith in business to let the performance of the money ever get new money. "
1335,0:04:27,0:04:27,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.  Well Charlie saw a lot of that actually.  I don't like those businesses.  Tell them what happened on clear path.  Chile.
1336,0:04:27,0:05:11,SPEAKER 3," Now it's a business said everybody's tempted to the Ryney login Good  afternoon.  My name is Hannah Hayes and I'm a high schooler from Iowa.  You said earlier  today that transitioning to renewable energy has the people and capital to support it.  So with enough investment in renewables,  the development of energy storage technology to soon meet Iowa's energy needs and support from the government to system through inflation reduction act funding,  why hasn't Berkshire Hathaway energy truly invested in the future by accelerating retirement plans?  For the coal plants which have high operating costs and are currently Iowa's biggest carbon polluter and will continue to be until they're finally retired in 2049,  which is too late to be curbing emissions according to the IPCC."
1337,0:06:07,0:06:24,SPEAKER 8," It's very interesting.  In Iowa,  we have actually produced more wind energy than is used.  The total amount of energy used by our customers,  but it's not produced about 24 hours a day necessarily.  So there's problems. And incidentally in Iowa,  significantly we're not going to be able to get any of those. And incidentally in Iowa, a significant majority of counties welcome us when we come around and want to put in wind and some don't want it."
1338,0:06:43,0:06:46,SPEAKER 3," I mean, it is a,  there's not my backyard someplace."
1339,0:06:50,0:06:54,BUFFETT, There's other places where they love the money they get from small  poly grounds and people that like the taxes are paid.
1340,0:06:58,0:07:04,SPEAKER 3," But I would say that if there's one state in the union that stands out in the development,  it's Iowa.  But what's also interesting in Iowa is that we have one other major company. "
1341,0:07:14,0:07:19,SPEAKER 8, There's always loads of little co-ops and all kinds of things that sell electricity.
1342,0:07:22,0:07:23,BUFFETT,"But we have one major competitor. And our prices are significantly lower. And as a matter of fact,  we are now in the Omaha Public Power District and three miles or four miles away,  we're selling electricity in Iowa.  And we are selling it cheaper even though public power was invented in Nebraska and has been a, I think it's"
1343,0:07:48,0:07:51,SPEAKER 3," Georgia Norris did it back in the 1930s.  And  it's Nebraska's resisted to some extent,  wind power more than Iowa."
1344,0:08:03,0:08:03,SPEAKER 4," But  like I said, our competitor or all of the other sources hasn't really pursued it the way we have."
1345,0:08:10,0:08:18,BUFFETT," But I would say that our record in wind and solar has not been  topped by any utility in the United States. And of course, it's been aided by the fact that most utilities pay out 70 or 80% of earnings and dividends. And we haven't taken a common dividend out of,  we haven't taken a common dividend out of, you know, for 20 years, we reinvested, I don't know how many billion that's the reason why the earnings have gone from 200 million to 4 billion.  But we're not earning. "
1346,0:08:48,0:08:53,SPEAKER 3, We're earning a higher rate of return on capital than we were when we started.  We just put way more capital into the businesses.
1347,0:08:54,0:08:55,BUFFETT, We went along and kept reinvesting the capital.
1348,0:08:56,0:08:59,SPEAKER 4, So I wish Greg were to tell you more details about it.
1349,0:09:00,0:09:01,BUFFETT," But,  but, but,  I would say that we'd put up, we'd really put a Berkshire Hathaway Energy's record against any utility in the United States.  Charlie, you've watched it."
1350,0:09:15,0:09:43,SPEAKER 4," Well, I have and I'm  not personally at  all sure how bad the global warming is going to be.  I think I don't think anybody knows for sure whether the  seeds are going to rise two inches or 20 feet.  And so I think there's a lot of false claims here in the world where much is not known. "
1351,0:09:43,0:09:46,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, we,  Wyoming,  there is a lot of wind in Wyoming and we are building transmission line to extend out through the West.  But it was World War II and they told us to do it.  And somebody who we had a czar and in Washington could say, you know, just get it done.  Like I said to Henry Kaiser on building ships, you know, you can't believe it.  You can't believe how far ahead we would be down from where we are. "
1352,0:10:16,0:10:18,BUFFETT, But we've got some money.
1353,0:10:19,0:10:36,SPEAKER 3," We've got the know how and we do spend about this year,  our depreciation in our utility company is on the order of $4 billion.  And we spend maybe $3 billion additional left. "
1354,0:10:36,0:10:44,BUFFETT," So maybe we spend $7 billion.  And, and  there are very few companies in the.  And the utility industry that are spending,  you know, that percentage of their depreciated.  But we'd love to be spending more. "
1355,0:10:50,0:10:51,SPEAKER 3, But there are people.
1356,0:10:52,0:10:58,BUFFETT, There are people all over the.  Don't want.  And I want the pipeline to go through there.
1357,0:10:58,0:11:00,SPEAKER 3," They don't want to the whatever it may be.  And that is the problem of a democracy.  And even as I mentioned within I will you've got a great many counties that majority,  great majority of the counties."
1358,0:11:12,0:11:12,SPEAKER 4, I think.
1359,0:11:12,0:11:17,BUFFETT," So welcome the wind power and you've got some counties that don't like it.  And we're obviously going to work with the ones that want to work with us.  We do not have the ability to go in and tell anybody what to do on that.  And there's a public utility commission in every state.  That basically governs what we earn on it, what we do. And that's the way the industry is developed. And that's not bad. And unless you get into things that.  That in effect.  Extend their part of a country wide system rather than a statewide system."
1360,0:11:52,0:12:12,SPEAKER 4, I think also that even if we weren't worried about global warming.  It would make sense to shift to renewables to conserve our hydrocarbons.  There's certain things hydrocarbons can do.  Nothing else can do.  And there are only so much of them there.  Why not be cautious?
1361,0:12:12,0:12:12,SPEAKER 1, And.
1362,0:12:12,0:12:12,BUFFETT, The good.  And the and the cause.
1363,0:12:15,0:12:17,SPEAKER 3, They've got so much more efficient to them.
1364,0:12:17,0:12:18,BUFFETT," I mean, the the winds. "
1365,0:12:18,0:12:24,SPEAKER 3," I mean, if you look at what we're doing now,  those towers are way more efficient and. "
1366,0:12:24,0:12:26,SPEAKER 4, But there's a lot of.
1367,0:12:26,0:12:29,SPEAKER 3, A lot of people that are talking.
1368,0:12:30,0:12:32,SPEAKER 6, That.
1369,0:12:33,0:12:37,SPEAKER 3, There are my things that can't be done and then there's.  There's a.
1370,0:12:38,0:12:39,SPEAKER 4, There's a lot of nonsense in this field.
1371,0:12:40,0:12:40,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
1372,0:12:40,0:12:42,SPEAKER 4," You know, if you like nonsense,  this is.  The field for you. "
1373,0:12:43,0:12:46,SPEAKER 3," Well, we're, but we're in the field. "
1374,0:12:46,0:12:47,BUFFETT, I know.
1375,0:12:48,0:12:48,SPEAKER 9, I know.
1376,0:12:48,0:12:50,BUFFETT," Okay, Becky. "
1377,0:12:51,0:13:15,SPEAKER 1," This is a question from Monroe Richardson.  The Wall Street Journal reported in March that oil producers are producing less oil and may have reached their peak in the Permian Basin.  Given the major positions of both.  Occidental petroleum and Chevron in the Permian.  Would you please explain the rationale for Berkshire significant holdings of both those companies considering that future?  Well, there's no question. "
1378,0:13:15,0:13:19,BUFFETT, It's really interesting about oil.  Charlie knows way more about oil.  I don't know what when did you.
1379,0:13:19,0:13:25,SPEAKER 8," Buy that royalty and.  Her bakers field or wherever it is.  But that was before I met you, right? "
1380,0:13:25,0:13:32,SPEAKER 4," Yes, no, it wasn't before it was, but it was.  Yes, it was.  It's just before.  Right.  Yeah. "
1381,0:13:32,0:13:32,SPEAKER 1, And.
1382,0:13:33,0:13:37,SPEAKER 4," That got him early still pay me $70,000 a year. "
1383,0:13:38,0:13:40,BUFFETT," Would you pay for the $1,000? "
1384,0:13:41,0:13:42,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
1385,0:13:43,0:13:44,SPEAKER 3, Now that's the opposite of the Permian.
1386,0:13:45,0:13:47,BUFFETT, My dad.
1387,0:13:48,0:13:56,SPEAKER 3," Bought $1,000 or $1,500 with the Royal lease.  Before he died in 1964,  he left it on my mother."
1388,0:13:57,0:13:58,SPEAKER 4, My mother left him.
1389,0:14:00,0:14:21,SPEAKER 3," Her two daughters and my older sister died and my younger sister's here today and she gets these.  It's every month and she knows about all these different fields and what they're producing and.  That's.  That's the reality of half of the oil production or something around that.  In the United States and then the other half.   Is shale and.  And you know, if you've gone to the movies and ever watched oil.  You've never watched the things that are pumping."
1390,0:14:32,0:14:33,SPEAKER 9," I'm always well,  he said, California."
1391,0:14:36,0:14:36,SPEAKER 3, You see these.
1392,0:14:37,0:14:39,BUFFETT, You see these gushers of oil.
1393,0:14:39,0:14:39,SPEAKER 1," Well,  in the Permian."
1394,0:14:41,0:14:42,SPEAKER 4, I'm with.
1395,0:14:42,0:14:45,SPEAKER 8, This should sink in on you.  And the first day.
1396,0:14:45,0:14:47,SPEAKER 3, The first day when you  bring in a well.
1397,0:14:49,0:14:50,SPEAKER 1," You  know, it may be."
1398,0:14:51,0:14:54,SPEAKER 4," The 12,000 barrels and maybe 15,000 barrels.  And it's even it's dangerous."
1399,0:14:58,0:14:58,SPEAKER 1, That.
1400,0:14:59,0:15:02,BUFFETT, Occidental had one come into.  I think in 19
1401,0:15:02,0:15:03,SPEAKER 3,",000 barrels or something. "
1402,0:15:03,0:15:04,BUFFETT, I got one day.
1403,0:15:05,0:15:05,SPEAKER 1, And.
1404,0:15:06,0:15:07,SPEAKER 5, In a year.
1405,0:15:07,0:15:08,SPEAKER 8, Year and a half.
1406,0:15:09,0:15:11,SPEAKER 6, It becomes.  Rightly nothing.
1407,0:15:12,0:15:14,SPEAKER 8, It's just it's a different business.
1408,0:15:15,0:15:17,BUFFETT, In effect.  And the United States.
1409,0:15:17,0:15:18,SPEAKER 8, It's interesting.
1410,0:15:18,0:15:19,SPEAKER 1, We use.
1411,0:15:19,0:15:20,SPEAKER 6, What are we use.
1412,0:15:21,0:15:22,BUFFETT, Maybe 11 or a fraction.
1413,0:15:23,0:15:28,SPEAKER 3, What we produce 11 fraction million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
1414,0:15:29,0:15:29,SPEAKER 4, But.
1415,0:15:30,0:15:34,SPEAKER 3," If sales stopped, I mean, it would drop to 6 million very fast. "
1416,0:15:35,0:15:35,SPEAKER 1, Well.
1417,0:15:35,0:15:38,SPEAKER 3, Just imagine taking 5 million barrels a day out of the production.
1418,0:15:39,0:15:41,BUFFETT, In the world.
1419,0:15:42,0:15:42,SPEAKER 8, And.  And then we're also taking down our strategic.
1420,0:15:47,0:15:47,BUFFETT, Petroleum Reserve.
1421,0:15:51,0:15:52,SPEAKER 3, You don't have to drill.
1422,0:15:53,0:15:54,SPEAKER 5, It's just that we've got to.  And it was supposed to be strategic.
1423,0:15:56,0:15:59,BUFFETT, But but it gets involved in politics.  And so.
1424,0:16:02,0:16:04,SPEAKER 3," There's all.  When you're a business,  you don't have different kinds of businesses, basically."
1425,0:16:07,0:16:08,SPEAKER 1, And.  And.  We like.
1426,0:16:09,0:16:12,BUFFETT, Occidental's position in the.  Permian.
1427,0:16:12,0:16:12,SPEAKER 4, We.
1428,0:16:13,0:16:14,BUFFETT, We wouldn't like.
1429,0:16:15,0:16:16,SPEAKER 3, That position.
1430,0:16:16,0:16:16,SPEAKER 1," Well,  it got to minus one day."
1431,0:16:19,0:16:19,SPEAKER 4, It got to minus.
1432,0:16:20,0:16:20,SPEAKER 3, Thirty dollars.
1433,0:16:20,0:16:20,SPEAKER 1, A.
1434,0:16:21,0:16:21,SPEAKER 6, Bear.
1435,0:16:21,0:16:22,BUFFETT," What was crazy, of course. "
1436,0:16:22,0:16:22,SPEAKER 4, But.
1437,0:16:23,0:16:24,SPEAKER 5, But if oil sells.
1438,0:16:24,0:16:25,BUFFETT, At X.  And we do very well.  And it was also half of X.  Your costs are the same.  And it doesn't change the production.  And it doesn't work as well.
1439,0:16:35,0:16:37,SPEAKER 3, But it also brings down the oil production.
1440,0:16:37,0:16:39,BUFFETT, Of the United States very fast.
1441,0:16:39,0:16:39,SPEAKER 3, So.
1442,0:16:40,0:16:42,BUFFETT, We don't know what oil prices will be.
1443,0:16:42,0:16:44,SPEAKER 8, But we do very much.
1444,0:16:45,0:16:45,SPEAKER 4, Like.
1445,0:16:46,0:16:46,SPEAKER 9, The.
1446,0:16:46,0:16:48,BUFFETT," Occidental position they have.  And that's why we finance them.  Few years ago, and it looks like it was a terrible mistake.  When the oil market just totally collapsed.  And then it changed around."
1447,0:16:59,0:16:59,SPEAKER 1, And.
1448,0:17:00,0:17:04,SPEAKER 3," We bought a lot of the common stock.  In the last few months, they've reduced. "
1449,0:17:05,0:17:08,BUFFETT," Our preferred,  which we don't like. "
1450,0:17:09,0:17:09,SPEAKER 3, Obviously.
1451,0:17:09,0:17:12,BUFFETT, We'd be disappointed in them.
1452,0:17:12,0:17:13,SPEAKER 8, If they didn't reduce it.
1453,0:17:14,0:17:16,SPEAKER 3, It's intelligent from their standpoint.
1454,0:17:16,0:17:16,SPEAKER 9, So we've taken.
1455,0:17:17,0:17:18,SPEAKER 8, Of the $10 billion preferred.
1456,0:17:18,0:17:18,BUFFETT, We've gotten.  And before. 500.  Million dollars of it.  Retired at 100.
1457,0:17:23,0:17:23,SPEAKER 3, Number.
1458,0:17:23,0:17:23,BUFFETT, Sent apart.
1459,0:17:24,0:17:24,SPEAKER 6, But.
1460,0:17:26,0:17:27,BUFFETT, Vicki.
1461,0:17:27,0:17:30,SPEAKER 3, Hollab.  Is a.
1462,0:17:31,0:17:34,BUFFETT, She's an extraordinary.  Manager.
1463,0:17:34,0:17:35,SPEAKER 6, Of.
1464,0:17:35,0:17:35,BUFFETT, Occidental.
1465,0:17:36,0:17:48,SPEAKER 3, Her first job was with city service.  That was the first stock I bought in 1942.  She knows.  What happens beneath the service.
1466,0:17:48,0:17:50,SPEAKER 8, I know the.
1467,0:17:50,0:17:51,BUFFETT, I know the.
1468,0:17:53,0:17:53,SPEAKER 6, Math of it.
1469,0:17:54,0:17:54,SPEAKER 9, But.
1470,0:17:55,0:17:55,BUFFETT, I wouldn't know.
1471,0:17:56,0:17:58,SPEAKER 3, I wouldn't have a famous idea what to do if I was in an oil field.
1472,0:17:58,0:18:04,BUFFETT," I mean, I don't.  I can dig to defeat down.  I can't.  In my backyard.  And I can.  That's my. "
1473,0:18:05,0:18:07,SPEAKER 3, That's my understanding of subsoil.
1474,0:18:08,0:18:09,SPEAKER 1, In the world.
1475,0:18:09,0:18:09,SPEAKER 5, I can't  picture the field that Charlie.
1476,0:18:12,0:18:13,BUFFETT, Has been collecting that monthly.
1477,0:18:14,0:18:15,SPEAKER 6, Check from.
1478,0:18:16,0:18:16,SPEAKER 4, From.
1479,0:18:17,0:18:17,SPEAKER 1, Fifty.
1480,0:18:18,0:18:19,SPEAKER 8, Plus year sixty.
1481,0:18:20,0:18:20,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1482,0:18:21,0:18:29,SPEAKER 3, Or my sister.  Getting at various fields where they just keep pumping and pumping and pumping in.
1483,0:18:29,0:18:33,SPEAKER 1, And.  Uh.  We.
1484,0:18:33,0:18:35,SPEAKER 4, In the United States.
1485,0:18:36,0:18:38,BUFFETT, Or lucky to have the ability to produce.
1486,0:18:39,0:18:39,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1487,0:18:39,0:18:41,BUFFETT, The kind of oil we've got from.
1488,0:18:42,0:18:43,SPEAKER 3," Jail, but it is not. "
1489,0:18:44,0:18:45,BUFFETT, A long term.
1490,0:18:46,0:18:47,SPEAKER 3, Source.
1491,0:18:48,0:18:48,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1492,0:18:49,0:18:55,BUFFETT, Like you might think by.  Watching movies about.  The sort.
1493,0:18:56,0:18:56,SPEAKER 3, Charlie.
1494,0:18:56,0:18:56,SPEAKER 9, Damn it.
1495,0:18:56,0:18:56,SPEAKER 1, And.
1496,0:18:57,0:19:05,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it really dies fast.  Those are all those.  If you like quick death of your.  We have them for you. "
1497,0:19:06,0:19:06,SPEAKER 1, No.
1498,0:19:07,0:19:07,SPEAKER 6, But.
1499,0:19:07,0:19:08,SPEAKER 5, Occidental.
1500,0:19:09,0:19:09,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1501,0:19:10,0:19:11,BUFFETT, They're doing a lot of good things.
1502,0:19:12,0:19:13,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.  They do a lot.
1503,0:19:13,0:19:13,SPEAKER 4, Oh.  And the.
1504,0:19:15,0:19:15,SPEAKER 6, Yep.
1505,0:19:16,0:19:16,SPEAKER 1, There.
1506,0:19:16,0:19:17,SPEAKER 4, They they're doing it.  And the profit.
1507,0:19:17,0:19:18,SPEAKER 3, But it's.
1508,0:19:18,0:19:18,SPEAKER 4, It's a different.
1509,0:19:19,0:19:19,SPEAKER 3, Kind of.
1510,0:19:19,0:19:20,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're  going to be.
1511,0:19:21,0:19:21,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.  And that's true of almost half the oil produced in the United States.
1512,0:19:25,0:19:26,SPEAKER 1, And.
1513,0:19:28,0:19:28,SPEAKER 8, There's time.
1514,0:19:28,0:19:47,SPEAKER 4, A little down there that nobody knows how to produce.  And they've been working at it for like 50 years.  But they worked at the existing shale production for about 50 years before they figured it out.  And it was weirdly complicated when they finally were able to do it.  There's only one type of sand that works.
1515,0:19:47,0:19:49,SPEAKER 3, Can you imagine a horror?
1516,0:19:49,0:19:50,SPEAKER 4, The novel.
1517,0:19:51,0:19:52,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.
1518,0:19:52,0:19:52,SPEAKER 1, Why.
1519,0:19:52,0:19:53,BUFFETT, You know that.
1520,0:19:54,0:19:55,SPEAKER 3, Maybe a mile a half or something.
1521,0:19:56,0:19:58,BUFFETT, It's just so different.
1522,0:19:58,0:20:00,SPEAKER 5, Then what you think about.
1523,0:20:01,0:20:01,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  I go laterally for three miles.  Two miles down."
1524,0:20:05,0:20:05,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.
1525,0:20:17,0:20:18,SPEAKER 1,How the hell do you build two or three miles laterally when you're already two or three miles under the earth?  They've mastered a lot of very tricky technology.  Do we only get any oil out of these wells at all? And we love the.  Position with.  The.
1526,0:20:20,0:20:21,SPEAKER 3, Yeah.
1527,0:20:21,0:20:22,BUFFETT, We love having picky run it.
1528,0:20:22,0:20:23,SPEAKER 3, And.
1529,0:20:24,0:20:31,SPEAKER 4, They've been.  There's a lot more old down there if anybody can figure out another magic trick.  That's all we need is another magic trick.
1530,0:20:32,0:20:33,SPEAKER 3, But.
1531,0:20:33,0:20:34,SPEAKER 8, I've said I'll have some other things too.
1532,0:20:35,0:20:35,SPEAKER 3, Yes.
1533,0:20:35,0:20:36,SPEAKER 1, Yes.  But.
1534,0:20:37,0:20:38,SPEAKER 6, But.
1535,0:20:38,0:20:38,SPEAKER 1, It.
1536,0:20:39,0:20:39,SPEAKER 3, The  price of oil still is.  Incredibly important in terms of the economics of short lived oil.
1537,0:20:45,0:20:46,SPEAKER 6, I mean.
1538,0:20:46,0:20:47,BUFFETT, No question about that.
1539,0:20:48,0:20:50,SPEAKER 1, Uh.  And.  Well.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.
1540,0:20:50,0:20:50,SPEAKER 3, I I.
1541,0:20:50,0:20:50,SPEAKER 1, I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I.  I don't.
1542,0:20:50,0:20:52,SPEAKER 3, If it's.  And we are.  We will incidentally.
1543,0:20:53,0:20:53,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1544,0:20:54,0:20:54,SPEAKER 6, You know.
1545,0:20:56,0:20:59,SPEAKER 3, There are speculation about us buying control.
1546,0:20:59,0:21:00,SPEAKER 6, We're not going to take.
1547,0:21:00,0:21:06,BUFFETT," We don't.  We've got the right management money and we can't.  We would know what to do with it and carry with my know,  what to do in oil.  Meeting your buying coal and be like going out and seeking the.  What acquire a cancer or something.  You can't even borrow to expand a coal mine now."
1548,0:21:18,0:21:18,SPEAKER 6, It's really.
1549,0:21:19,0:21:19,SPEAKER 1, It got very.
1550,0:21:20,0:21:20,SPEAKER 4, Unfashionable.
1551,0:21:22,0:21:22,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  And we think frankly some things that are ridiculous and on both sides on both and in both extremes.  I mean, you're  dealing with physics."
1552,0:21:34,0:21:35,BUFFETT, You're dealing with them.
1553,0:21:35,0:21:35,SPEAKER 4," You know,  it's."
1554,0:21:37,0:21:39,SPEAKER 5, The politicization.
1555,0:21:40,0:21:40,SPEAKER 1, Of.
1556,0:21:41,0:21:56,SPEAKER 3," Of positions on something that's enormously important in terms of energy is just.  Uh, it's just lends itself to.  To demagogues and fundraisers and advisory organizations and everybody inside. "
1557,0:21:57,0:21:58,SPEAKER 1, But.  Uh.  And.
1558,0:22:00,0:22:02,SPEAKER 8, We will make rational decisions and.
1559,0:22:03,0:22:06,SPEAKER 4, We do not think it's un-American to be producing oil.  And there is no.  Oil basin in the United States that compares to the Permian.  In terms of promise.
1560,0:22:15,0:22:16,BUFFETT," Yeah, we were lucky. "
1561,0:22:17,0:22:19,SPEAKER 5," Well, we didn't know it was there. "
1562,0:22:19,0:22:20,BUFFETT, Until.
1563,0:22:21,0:22:23,SPEAKER 3," Yeah,  not that many years ago. "
1564,0:22:24,0:22:30,SPEAKER 4," It's sort of been used up and they always knew the show was there,  but they thought it was going to stay un-recoverable forever. "
1565,0:22:31,0:22:39,SPEAKER 8, The second or third stock I bought was Texas Pacific Land Trust.  And they owned all three million acres down there and they were.
1566,0:22:40,0:22:42,SPEAKER 3, They were grazing revenues of 10
1567,0:22:42,0:22:48,SPEAKER 8,",000 a year or something like that.  They were sitting on this incredible amount of oil and basically that company. "
1568,0:22:49,0:22:55,SPEAKER 3, But it's now actually part of Chevron and went through Texaco and did all kinds of things and and they're still.
1569,0:22:56,0:23:00,SPEAKER 8," There's still a Texas Pacific Land Trust,  but a lot of that property is. "
1570,0:23:01,0:23:06,SPEAKER 3," Is fee fee owned by by their minerals are owned by by Chevron,  which is some advantage, but it's."
1571,0:23:09,0:23:09,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1572,0:23:11,0:23:18,BUFFETT," Well, it's an interesting subject.  I'll put it that way and and we will not be making any offer for control of. "
1573,0:23:19,0:23:19,SPEAKER 4," A lot of the number,  but we love the shares we have and we may or may not."
1574,0:23:24,0:23:26,SPEAKER 8," Own more in the future,  but but we certainly have warrants on on which we got as part of the original deal on a very substantial amount of stock at around $59 to share and. And the warrants last a long time."
1575,0:23:40,0:23:41,BUFFETT, I'm glad we have them.
1576,0:23:42,0:23:42,SPEAKER 3," Okay,  station seven."
1577,0:23:45,0:23:49,SPEAKER 1," My name is Max.  Joe and from Toronto,  Canada.  I have a question for Charlie regarding statement you made in the past.  You once mentioned that you would prefer to hire someone with IQ of 130 who believes is 120 over someone with IQ of 150 who thinks it's 170.  Understand that you were referring to Elon Musk.  Given the reason why you're here,  the reason success of his ventures such as Tesla,  SpaceX and Starlink.  I'm curious to know.  If you still hold the view that Elon Musk overestimate himself.  Thank you so much. "
1578,0:24:36,0:24:44,SPEAKER 4," Well, yes, I think over Elon Musk over estimates himself,  but he has the. "
1579,0:24:44,0:24:44,SPEAKER 1," He is very talented.  So, I'm sure he's  over estimating somebody who doesn't need to overestimate to be very talented."
1580,0:24:54,0:25:17,SPEAKER 3," There's a Bill Maher program about a week old,  maybe two weeks old, but  but he interviews Elon.  Elon does a terrific job.  Told us all with Bill Maher who it's worth watching and.  And he's a brilliant,  brilliant guy and I would say that.  You know, he might score over 170,  but."
1581,0:25:22,0:25:23,SPEAKER 6, But he.
1582,0:25:24,0:25:26,BUFFETT," You know, it's. "
1583,0:25:27,0:25:30,SPEAKER 3, He he dreams about things and they.
1584,0:25:30,0:25:30,SPEAKER 1, They.
1585,0:25:31,0:25:33,BUFFETT, His dreams have got a  foundation.
1586,0:25:34,0:25:41,SPEAKER 4, You would not have achieved.  What he has in life if he hadn't tried for unreasonably extreme.
1587,0:25:42,0:25:42,SPEAKER 6, Object is.
1588,0:25:43,0:25:47,SPEAKER 4, He likes taking on the impossible job and doing it.
1589,0:25:48,0:25:48,SPEAKER 3, We're different.
1590,0:25:49,0:25:52,SPEAKER 4, I weren't.  I are looking for the easy job that we can identify.
1591,0:25:53,0:25:54,BUFFETT," Yeah, yeah,  and we can do it playing tic-tac."
1592,0:25:56,0:26:00,SPEAKER 5," Oh, we'll do it.  You know, I mean.  We have a de  whole way of going to the whole way."
1593,0:26:02,0:26:02,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
1594,0:26:03,0:26:05,SPEAKER 8, But we don't want to compete with the other.  And a lot of things.
1595,0:26:06,0:26:09,BUFFETT," I mean, you know, we don't want that much failure. "
1596,0:26:09,0:26:10,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.
1597,0:26:13,0:26:21,SPEAKER 3," And.  And it takes over your life and I'm in a way that it just doesn't fit us,  but but you know,  they're going to be.  Well, there have been important things done by Elon already and. "
1598,0:26:30,0:26:33,BUFFETT, It requires.
1599,0:26:33,0:26:39,SPEAKER 4, Kineticism is the word yet is the word.  He.
1600,0:26:40,0:26:42,BUFFETT," Well, it isn't quite the word,  but you know, but he.  It is a dedication.   Dissolving the impossible and.  And every now and then they'll do it and.  But it would be torturous. mayor Charlie."
1601,0:26:56,0:26:56,SPEAKER 1, And.
1602,0:26:58,0:27:00,SPEAKER 5, I just.
1603,0:27:00,0:27:12,BUFFETT, I like the way I'm living and I would  enjoy being in his but he would enjoy being in my shoes either.  What's what's the.  Balmora interview.
1604,0:27:13,0:27:13,SPEAKER 5," Okay, Becky. "
1605,0:27:14,0:27:41,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from Foster Taylor.  At the 2010 Berkshire annual meeting,  you said the one question that you would ask of the Berkshire CEO would be about the distribution of cash to shareholders as the Berkshire cash pile grows larger and larger.  So let me ask that question.  Do you still feel confident of the future prospects for over $100 billion in cash on hand?  Or are we getting closer to cash distributions? "
1606,0:27:43,0:27:51,SPEAKER 3, Well.  Are the one thing Berkshire shares are selling for less than we think they're worth.
1607,0:27:52,0:27:58,BUFFETT," That's a pretty, it could be a pretty big.  Way that is  distributed cash that the but we'd rather what we really like to do is buy great businesses.  If we could buy a company for 15 billion or 75 billion. 100 billion."
1608,0:28:12,0:28:20,SPEAKER 3," We could do it and we can do it in our words.  Good.  It's difficult with a public company because in effect,  if you've been on a company.  You may have to pay for it.  I think the bid and their shareholders vote months later and you're giving an option.  If we're good for it and other guy has a way to. "
1609,0:28:34,0:28:40,BUFFETT," Top you or all kinds of thing.  They can get out of it.   You get paid 2% for that or 1% for that.  That is not an appropriate price.  And on the other hand,  Delaware will decide whether  they should do it or not. And that's the way the world is."
1610,0:28:53,0:28:53,SPEAKER 1," I mean, that's the way the world is.  I mean, that's the way it is. "
1611,0:28:53,0:28:55,BUFFETT," I mean, that's the law. "
1612,0:28:55,0:28:55,SPEAKER 5, So it'd  be easier to do with a private company and there aren't very many that are big.
1613,0:29:01,0:29:02,SPEAKER 3," On the other hand, there aren't very,  there's nobody else that can quite make a deal like we can under certain under the right service.  And there could be a situation where a bunch of very.  A number of very decent companies have got a very uncomfortable. "
1614,0:29:20,0:29:20,SPEAKER 4," Uh,  uh, borrowing structure and."
1615,0:29:23,0:29:30,SPEAKER 3," Uh, uh, money comes due to them at the exact wrong time.  And that's when they pick up a phone is that. "
1616,0:29:31,0:29:35,BUFFETT," Tiffany and Harley Davidson and you name it.  I mean, a whole bunch of companies. "
1617,0:29:35,0:29:36,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  in 2008, that sort of thing will happen again.  Whether whether results in us getting the calls or what the world is exactly at that time."
1618,0:29:46,0:29:48,BUFFETT, But the one thing we know is that.
1619,0:29:49,0:29:52,SPEAKER 3, That.  The number of phone calls that you can make at a time like that.
1620,0:29:53,0:29:56,SPEAKER 4," It's very, very limited at.  And,  and, uh, there can be good companies."
1621,0:30:00,0:30:02,BUFFETT," They don't want to sell the company necessarily,  but they may want to, they just may need."
1622,0:30:04,0:30:07,SPEAKER 3," Five or 10 or $20 billion,  depending on what company you're talking about.  And, uh,  that can happen."
1623,0:30:11,0:30:14,SPEAKER 8," Our own shareholders can be selling the stock to.   But we'll never do anything to make them solid shape and we'll tell them the truth about what the business is.  But if market circumstances result in us being able to buy.  And 50 billion of our own stock will buy it.  Uh, so we'll see what we'll see what the world holds."
1624,0:30:29,0:30:31,BUFFETT," But I, I don't, I don't. "
1625,0:30:32,0:30:34,SPEAKER 8," We don't have the opportunities we used to have,  but."
1626,0:30:36,0:30:40,BUFFETT," We've got, we've got enough and we're making money with what the things we have. "
1627,0:30:40,0:30:41,SPEAKER 8, It isn't killing a stall.
1628,0:30:41,0:30:42,SPEAKER 5, A hundred.
1629,0:30:42,0:30:43,SPEAKER 6, A hundred.
1630,0:30:44,0:30:46,BUFFETT, Thirty billion of.
1631,0:30:46,0:30:47,SPEAKER 8," Uh,  uh,  bills at five percent plus bond equivalent yields and everybody says, well, you know, you're going to get out of the view."
1632,0:30:53,0:30:53,SPEAKER 9, I  don't have the faintest ideal yields during the future.
1633,0:30:58,0:31:01,SPEAKER 8," And, you know,  the prime rate was 21.5%.   In 19 81 or two.  And they were worried that it was going to go totally out of spin out of control.  And boker kept it from happening."
1634,0:31:09,0:31:11,BUFFETT, But a boker hadn't been in there.  Who that almost what happened.
1635,0:31:12,0:31:12,SPEAKER 3," That.  Uh,  so we're running Berkshire so that, uh, we'll do okay and maybe we'll do a little bit better than okay.  Charlie."
1636,0:31:22,0:31:23,SPEAKER 4, Okay.  Maybe fine.
1637,0:31:23,0:31:25,BUFFETT, Okay.
1638,0:31:25,0:31:25,SPEAKER 8, Station eight.
1639,0:31:28,0:31:31,SPEAKER 1," Hello, Mr.  Buffett Buffett and Mr. "
1640,0:31:31,0:31:31,SPEAKER 9, Munger.
1641,0:31:32,0:31:59,SPEAKER 1, My name is Carlos Sanchez and I'm honored to be here from Guadalajara Mexico.  Mr.  Munger as a fellow lawyer.  I have a question regarding corporate law.  Considering your experience and success.  If you were to offer guidance to someone like Ralph.  When he was at the beginning of his career and before becoming Bear Strike had a way.  He was a lawyer.  What key principles or lessons would you suggest to help him excel in his professor?
1642,0:31:59,0:32:05,SPEAKER 4," Well, I'm not sure I quite caught all of that. "
1643,0:32:06,0:32:07,SPEAKER 5, But.
1644,0:32:09,0:32:22,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, what I don't think I have a lot of advice about how to succeed as a lawyer.  I have a son-in-law who describes modern law practice on a big firm.  He says, it's like a partner. "
1645,0:32:22,0:32:22,SPEAKER 1," He says,  it's like a pie eating contest where you win.  You get to eat more pie.  And I advise you to avoid that kind of a law firm.  Life is too short to just do nothing but eat pie.  Yeah. "
1646,0:32:44,0:32:48,SPEAKER 3, Charlie is not practice law since what?  1964?
1647,0:32:50,0:32:50,SPEAKER 8," Maybe you're, uh,  whatever was."
1648,0:32:52,0:32:52,SPEAKER 1," Uh, I'm a little bit of a  little bit of a problem."
1649,0:32:52,0:32:53,SPEAKER 3," But 1962.  62.  And, uh,  Charlie has given me four or five pieces of advice.  They don't really come from his legal background.  But, but because he knows the system so well and,  and, uh,  you know, really did.  Do quite well at Harvard Law School."
1650,0:33:19,0:33:20,SPEAKER 8, The spot is.  And I think it's a big of teachers and a few things.
1651,0:33:24,0:33:24,SPEAKER 5," Uh,  he has given me four or five solutions on things that nobody else in the world would have given me law firm or otherwise. And it, and it's, it's been a, within a set,  within a, almost a nano second."
1652,0:33:43,0:33:45,BUFFETT," I want to describe the problem to him.  And he just gave me the answer that nobody else would have come up with.  And, uh,  I, I told you one of them."
1653,0:33:52,0:33:55,SPEAKER 3," Last year, so I won't repeat it at this meeting, but, but,  uh, it's, uh, we've got the best lawyer in the world.  And Charlie,  it would something that really matters."
1654,0:34:04,0:34:05,BUFFETT," Uh,  and, uh, there have been times when I've taken advantage of that."
1655,0:34:11,0:34:14,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  uh,  and. "
1656,0:34:16,0:34:16,SPEAKER 4, I.
1657,0:34:17,0:34:19,BUFFETT, Charlie didn't want to be.
1658,0:34:20,0:34:20,SPEAKER 9, A lawyer.
1659,0:34:20,0:34:22,SPEAKER 8, He didn't want to sell his.
1660,0:34:22,0:34:26,SPEAKER 3, He's got a lot of time.  Maybe a 20 bucks an hour or something.
1661,0:34:26,0:34:30,BUFFETT," The people we thought were making the wrong decisions and he knew more about it.  And that just did not strike him.  It was a good way to go through life.  But I think he's probably right on that.  I think he'd, he'd really gotten to be miserable.  If he had to keep doing that, it's just no fun.  Be like me giving investment advice to somebody that."
1662,0:34:46,0:34:47,SPEAKER 8, Or taking it from somebody I had.
1663,0:34:48,0:34:51,SPEAKER 3," You know, that just, I just wouldn't want to do it right.  And Charlie got in.  So we decided to work for ourselves and this work been happy,  happily ever after. "
1664,0:34:59,0:35:01,SPEAKER 4, We have no complaints.
1665,0:35:02,0:35:03,SPEAKER 6," Yeah,  none. "
1666,0:35:04,0:35:07,BUFFETT," Okay, we're Becky. "
1667,0:35:08,0:35:53,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from Ryan Harding.  It's about the new 15% corporate minimum tax rate.  As he sees it,  its implementation is currently understood.  He thinks that as he understands it to apply over.  Or rolling three year periods and to be based on reported earnings.  First, does the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses in reported earnings under the current financial reporting standards contribute to the calculation for corporate minimum tax rate purposes?  And could it potentially convert some of those notional deferred taxes into cash taxes?  Even if a rise in the market price of a major holding is only temporary,  but rather extreme.  And then second,  could it reduce the effect of some of the renewable energy tax incentives and others? "
1668,0:35:54,0:35:54,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.
1669,0:35:55,0:36:20,SPEAKER 3," I think the answer on the second part probably is no,  but I don't want to say it is for sure because he's asking the same questions I ask a Mark Hamburg who's the smartest guy on combining,  understanding a business, understanding the tax code,  understanding SEC rules, and everything else.  That you'll find in corporate America.  And these questions, the particular question on marketable security, I don't think has been answered yet. And I think that there are a number of things about the new tax act that were not enacted."
1670,0:36:39,0:36:39,SPEAKER 6," But I would say this,  the, you know, we have said, that the tax law, you know, we have said ourselves what we think the proper approach to operating income,  we didn't design that because this tax law came along with some years back."
1671,0:36:58,0:36:59,SPEAKER 3," So we're,  we would think that you wouldn't include capital gains,  unrealized capital gains in, but we are having the Cannon Bank we've got enough.  I think no matter how things turn out, you know, the 15% tax doesn't bother me in the least and we can figure ways once we know the rules where we will pay the 15% tax.  And, you know, we were paying 52% tax,  the federal income taxes one.  I bought control in the partnership.  Up Berkshire Hathaway, I mean the tax rate come down dramatically and the deferred tax that was embodied,  for example, a Sanborn map when I was involved in a system that was allowed under the tax law to avoid that tax.  But that was a huge tax,  52%.  So we, we will live with this tax code and we do not think corporations are overtaxed in the United States.  And, uh,  you know, and I think that conversation about how we lose out to the world and all of this sort of thing is really nonsense. "
1672,0:38:21,0:38:22,SPEAKER 5," Uh,  but,  uh, we've got, we've got a new law that hasn't yet the regulations haven't been written on.  And when, when we know what the game is, we will absolutely figure out a way to paying 15% every year and which generally we've been paying any more.  And, as I, I pointed out,  if there were a thousand corporations in the United States that paid what Berkshire has been paying,  nobody else in the United States, no individual, no corporation, whatever pay any income tax,  Social Security tax, gift tax, or state tax, anything else.  A thousand like Berkshire Hathaway would produce the revenue that's being produced by the federal government that's being derived into the present tax code from everybody in the United States.  And I don't feel badly about that and I'd love to get it.  I don't know if there's one 500 or something of the sort done."
1673,0:39:18,0:39:18,SPEAKER 3," Uh,  what I'd like to do at, I can do it at this rate.  I'm happy to do it."
1674,0:39:24,0:39:25,SPEAKER 1, I  think we are privileged to live in the United States.
1675,0:39:30,0:39:34,SPEAKER 3," But we also have to control spending and, uh,  that's something that Congress doesn't quite like to give, like to do."
1676,0:39:40,0:39:45,BUFFETT," Uh, I think that's something that Congress doesn't want quite like to give,  like to do.  And they didn't like to do it.  My dad went to Congress,  but, but they've dug in more as the years have gone by."
1677,0:39:50,0:39:50,SPEAKER 6, Charlie?
1678,0:39:53,0:39:56,SPEAKER 4," Well, we would cover this subject earlier.  Yeah. "
1679,0:39:57,0:39:58,BUFFETT, Okay.
1680,0:39:59,0:39:59,SPEAKER 5," Now,  station nine, am I right on this?"
1681,0:40:04,0:40:04,SPEAKER 6, Yeah.
1682,0:40:06,0:40:18,SPEAKER 1," My name is Avalon Gross.  And I am from Los Angeles,  California.  I am a shareholder,  and it's my fourth year coming to the Woodstock of Capitalism. "
1683,0:40:20,0:40:21,SPEAKER 4," Hell,  hell. "
1684,0:40:21,0:40:22,SPEAKER 3, We're glad you came.
1685,0:40:23,0:40:43,SPEAKER 1," Thank  you so much for everything,  Warren and Buffett and Charlie Munger.  What is the funniest story that you have never told about each other?  And also, I'm glad you came.  And also, what is the hardest part of your business? "
1686,0:40:46,0:40:47,SPEAKER 5, I'll answer the second.
1687,0:40:47,0:40:54,SPEAKER 3, The second part of your question is that we don't have a heart business.
1688,0:40:54,0:40:55,BUFFETT, We love our business.
1689,0:40:55,0:40:56,SPEAKER 3," Every morning when I get up,  I feel good.  I don't know what's going to happen that day.   Maybe nothing will happen,  but maybe something will happen. And if nothing else, I'll roll some tea bills or something."
1690,0:41:07,0:41:08,BUFFETT," But it's,  it's.  It, I work, I work with the greatest group of people you've ever imagined."
1691,0:41:13,0:41:14,SPEAKER 6," I mean, we,  we, we like each other and nobody is after anybody else's job or anything of the sort."
1692,0:41:21,0:41:23,SPEAKER 3, It's ideal working conditions.  And it's five minutes from my home or thereabouts.
1693,0:41:28,0:41:30,BUFFETT, So I'm spent my life commuting.
1694,0:41:31,0:41:33,SPEAKER 3," I just can't imagine having it,  having anything better."
1695,0:41:34,0:41:35,SPEAKER 8," And,  and Charlie's got a lot of funny stories."
1696,0:41:38,0:41:38,SPEAKER 5, You haven't.
1697,0:41:39,0:41:40,SPEAKER 8," You haven't heard, but we'll see what you want to come up with. "
1698,0:41:41,0:41:44,SPEAKER 1," Well,  I think Warren and I are naturally so ridiculous that we don't need very many funny stories.  I, I, I be each do things that are peculiar enough so that we can keep one another amused."
1699,0:42:00,0:42:03,SPEAKER 3, Tell them what you told the lawyer when we were buying a hoshel cone.
1700,0:42:04,0:42:06,SPEAKER 4, I don't remember you tell them.
1701,0:42:06,0:42:06,SPEAKER 1," Well,  you remember."
1702,0:42:09,0:42:14,SPEAKER 3," It was nine 1966 and we were down a ball,  a more buying a ball department store and we needed a lawyer and we needed a lawyer who was nearby and would do exactly as told.  And Charlie came up with a very good lawyer from one more couple of years, I believe.  And I don't know whether Charlie remembers the instructions he gave a lawyer or not."
1703,0:42:36,0:42:37,SPEAKER 9," No,  I don't.  Oh, well. "
1704,0:42:39,0:42:42,SPEAKER 3," Charlie told the lawyer who we never met before and he said, well,  he just, he says treat Warren like I was 36 at the time or 35."
1705,0:42:49,0:42:53,BUFFETT," He said treat, treat Warren like any other 90 year old client. "
1706,0:42:54,0:43:01,SPEAKER 3, This guy knew exactly what he meant.  And we made the deal in a hurry and then we went to the bank.
1707,0:43:02,0:43:03,SPEAKER 8, The person national bank.
1708,0:43:03,0:43:06,SPEAKER 3," I believe it was a,  or Merrill National Bank actually.  And there was a following Cammy Slack there.  It wasn't it, Charlie?  And we, yeah, we wanted to borrow six million bucks against a $12 million purchase.  And Cammy looked at us and would be world remit."
1709,0:43:20,0:43:22,BUFFETT," They said, you want to borrow $6 million? "
1710,0:43:22,0:43:24,SPEAKER 3," That's a little hoshel cone.  And Charlie and I said something to the effect.  Well,  the Maryland National was our first call and if they didn't want to do it, we had another bank we don't want anyway.  They love us the money. "
1711,0:43:36,0:43:36,SPEAKER 6," But,  but when he said little old hoshel."
1712,0:43:39,0:43:39,SPEAKER 4," I don't call him,  we immediately start thinking maybe this isn't the best deal we've ever seen in our lives."
1713,0:43:43,0:43:46,SPEAKER 8," From that point on,  we were trying to figure it out to sell it. "
1714,0:43:47,0:43:48,BUFFETT," But we've had,  but wait.  We had as much fun.   Sandy Gautasman was involved with us then too.  And we had as much fun."
1715,0:43:59,0:44:16,SPEAKER 3," Out of deals that didn't work in a certain sense as the ones that did work.  I mean, it's, it's, you know, if you knew you were going to play games and play games.  You're going to get a big golf and you're going to hit a hole in one on every hole.  He just hit the ball and then went in the hole 300 yards away or 400 yards away. "
1716,0:44:17,0:44:19,BUFFETT," You would nobody play golf.  I mean,  part of the fun of the game is  the fact that you hit them into the woods and sometimes you hit them get them out and sometimes you don't.  So we are in the perfect sort of game and we both enjoy it and we have a lot of fun together and we don't have to do anything we don't.  I really believe in doing.  I mean, we are not dictated to it by any group.  And so we get to follow our own. "
1717,0:44:49,0:44:54,SPEAKER 3, We like to get the four DROUND destination as it says.
1718,0:44:55,0:44:56,SPEAKER 8," Forgism although with bemanship,  big."
1719,0:44:56,0:45:00,BUFFETT," Which we can run the company.  And that's a huge luxury in life.   And,  and we don't want to be president of any other company in the world or CEO or anything else.  Where, we have to conform to certain things that we really don't want to conform to."
1720,0:45:13,0:45:13,SPEAKER 6," That a  further description, Jeremy."
1721,0:45:16,0:45:16,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, it is. "
1722,0:45:17,0:45:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
1723,0:45:18,0:45:18,SPEAKER 3," Okay, Becky. "
1724,0:45:19,0:45:39,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from David Cass who is a professor at the Business School University of Maryland.  He says last year's annual meeting Warren mentioned that Berkshire had taken a large stake in Activision Blizzard as a merger arbitrage play.  Since the UK regulator has been a big part of the investment in the United States.  Block its acquisition by Microsoft,  his Berkshire reduced or sold its stake. "
1725,0:45:41,0:45:52,SPEAKER 4," Well, I think in terms of what we do with stocks.  We don't get information except when required to which is in the 13.  After what are we file and.  And there's some."
1726,0:45:54,0:45:57,SPEAKER 3, There's certain things you can actually figure out by looking at our 10.
1727,0:45:59,0:46:01,BUFFETT, Around 10.  Two which we follow this morning.
1728,0:46:02,0:46:03,SPEAKER 3, Which you have to look pretty hard.
1729,0:46:04,0:46:06,BUFFETT, But.  I would say this.
1730,0:46:08,0:46:08,SPEAKER 5, It's.
1731,0:46:09,0:46:13,SPEAKER 3, I think Microsoft has been.  Remarkably.
1732,0:46:14,0:46:16,SPEAKER 6, What's  the word.  Willing to.
1733,0:46:25,0:46:26,SPEAKER 1, To cooperate.
1734,0:46:27,0:46:27,SPEAKER 6, With.
1735,0:46:29,0:46:34,BUFFETT, Governing bodies and.  I mean they want to do the deal and they met them.
1736,0:46:35,0:46:37,SPEAKER 3, The opposition it seems to me.
1737,0:46:37,0:46:39,BUFFETT, More than halfway but.
1738,0:46:39,0:46:40,SPEAKER 6, That doesn't mean.
1739,0:46:41,0:46:42,BUFFETT, That it gets done if.
1740,0:46:43,0:46:45,SPEAKER 6, If.  I've given.
1741,0:46:46,0:46:56,BUFFETT, Country in this case the UK.  Want's to.  They're not better position to block it than.  The United States.  Just the way the world works.
1742,0:46:57,0:46:58,SPEAKER 1, And.
1743,0:46:59,0:47:03,SPEAKER 3, That doesn't get solved by offering more money.
1744,0:47:03,0:47:04,SPEAKER 8, So it.
1745,0:47:04,0:47:05,SPEAKER 1, It.
1746,0:47:05,0:47:09,BUFFETT, I don't know how it.  How it turns out.
1747,0:47:11,0:47:14,SPEAKER 3, But if it doesn't go through I don't think it's through any.
1748,0:47:15,0:47:17,BUFFETT, Any short coming.
1749,0:47:17,0:47:17,SPEAKER 3, By either.
1750,0:47:18,0:47:19,SPEAKER 4, Microsoft for.
1751,0:47:19,0:47:20,SPEAKER 8, But.
1752,0:47:23,0:47:24,BUFFETT, Not everything that should happen.
1753,0:47:24,0:47:29,SPEAKER 3, That's happened.  Well we weren't we ran into it when we.
1754,0:47:31,0:47:36,BUFFETT, When we bought.  What made the deal with the minion energy.  18 months ago and that they let us buy.
1755,0:47:40,0:47:42,SPEAKER 3, A good bit of what we wanted to buy and then.  And then.  There's.
1756,0:47:46,0:47:46,SPEAKER 4, Government in the facts.
1757,0:47:47,0:47:54,SPEAKER 3, That you can't buy something else which I think we would have done a better job with them.  Anybody else did in which.  The states involved in our.
1758,0:47:55,0:47:56,BUFFETT, Object to it which the customers did not.
1759,0:47:56,0:47:57,SPEAKER 3, But.
1760,0:47:59,0:47:59,SPEAKER 6, You don't.
1761,0:48:00,0:48:02,BUFFETT, You don't take on the United States government.
1762,0:48:03,0:48:06,SPEAKER 3, You know and.  You try and figure out things that.
1763,0:48:07,0:48:08,BUFFETT, That you won't have a problem with.
1764,0:48:09,0:48:09,SPEAKER 4, And.
1765,0:48:10,0:48:16,BUFFETT, I think.  In that case the US government made a mistake.  I think the British government's making a mistake in this case.
1766,0:48:16,0:48:16,SPEAKER 4, But.
1767,0:48:17,0:48:28,BUFFETT, That's that's life in the big city.  I was saying and.  What we do will depend on a lot of things.  Charlie.
1768,0:48:29,0:48:33,SPEAKER 4, Well I think.  What we do.  Yeah.
1769,0:48:36,0:48:36,SPEAKER 1, You  kiss that one off beautifully.
1770,0:48:40,0:48:45,BUFFETT, OK station 10.
1771,0:48:46,0:48:53,SPEAKER 1, I.  I.  Hi Warren.  Hi Charlie my name is Anderson fuller and I'm from.
1772,0:48:53,0:48:54,SPEAKER 9, I'm from.
1773,0:48:54,0:48:54,SPEAKER 1, Of.  And before  I ask my question I just want to thank you for all you've done to give us insight into your minds as investors.  So for me the most compelling takeaway from Berkshire is your guys emphasis on and successful use of properly aligned incentives.  In my view owning and leading a business has two central benefits first you directly benefit as the company goes through your.  Equity in it and second you have autonomy incentives for employees are a bit easier to understand such as offering benefits fair pay and creating a strong culture.  But I've always struggled to understand them at the highest level.  Even though you say Berkshire gives us managers significant flexibility it must be less than what they have when they were independent.  Additionally you would think passion and a willingness to sell would be inversely correlated.  So how exactly does Berkshire bridges gap and incentivize owners of its subsidiaries to.  Give up these benefits to Berkshire.
1774,0:49:49,0:49:49,SPEAKER 3, Thank you.
1775,0:49:50,0:49:52,BUFFETT, Well we really hope to find.
1776,0:49:53,0:49:56,SPEAKER 3, Is managers who love their business.
1777,0:49:57,0:50:01,BUFFETT, But don't.  Like a lot of what comes with it.
1778,0:50:02,0:50:14,SPEAKER 3, As a public company I mean if they have to spend a lot of time listening to people.  Tell them what to do about this or that and they can't afford to irritate them.  Or they have to.
1779,0:50:16,0:50:17,SPEAKER 8, Go along with their.
1780,0:50:17,0:50:17,BUFFETT, So I think that's a good idea to think about what to do about that.  And I think that's why I've been in trade association because you know whatever they may call it.  Because you don't want to look like a free rider and there's all kinds of things compromises that  people have to make in most jobs.  And Charlie and I solve that problem.  I had five bosses in my life.  And I liked all five of them and two of them.  Which is huge factors. And making my life.  And I think that's why I'm so excited to see how we're doing. And making my life better.  But I like all five of them.  A couple of them are.
1781,0:50:50,0:50:51,SPEAKER 3, Some people here.
1782,0:50:52,0:50:53,SPEAKER 5, Gacy Penny.
1783,0:50:53,0:50:54,BUFFETT, Cooper Smith.
1784,0:50:55,0:50:55,SPEAKER 6, You know.
1785,0:50:55,0:50:56,SPEAKER 8, Works at 75 cents an hour.
1786,0:50:57,0:50:57,SPEAKER 9, I love.
1787,0:50:57,0:50:59,SPEAKER 3, I love working at pennies.
1788,0:51:00,0:51:03,BUFFETT, Well I didn't love working at pennies.  But I love working.
1789,0:51:03,0:51:04,SPEAKER 9, For.
1790,0:51:05,0:51:05,SPEAKER 3, Cooper Smith.
1791,0:51:06,0:51:07,SPEAKER 1, And.  And.
1792,0:51:08,0:51:08,SPEAKER 4, You know.
1793,0:51:08,0:51:09,BUFFETT, What's 75 cents an hour.
1794,0:51:10,0:51:10,SPEAKER 1, But.
1795,0:51:10,0:51:11,SPEAKER 5, But I had.
1796,0:51:11,0:51:13,BUFFETT, I had to do what they call me to do.
1797,0:51:13,0:51:15,SPEAKER 8, Which was to sell men's shirts first and men's clothing.
1798,0:51:15,0:51:17,BUFFETT, And.  Children's clothing and so on.
1799,0:51:18,0:51:18,SPEAKER 4, And.
1800,0:51:19,0:51:22,SPEAKER 3, I love working for the newspaper and.
1801,0:51:22,0:51:26,BUFFETT, I had a great manager when I was a nurse in Nebraska.
1802,0:51:26,0:51:27,SPEAKER 8, Got to work for Ben Graham.
1803,0:51:28,0:51:29,BUFFETT, I mean everything worked out.
1804,0:51:30,0:51:31,SPEAKER 1, But.  But.
1805,0:51:32,0:51:34,BUFFETT, There's nothing like working for yourself.  And if you can't own a big company.
1806,0:51:39,0:51:41,SPEAKER 5, Working at Berkshire Hathaway.
1807,0:51:41,0:51:43,BUFFETT, We're running a company.
1808,0:51:44,0:51:45,SPEAKER 1, Is.
1809,0:51:46,0:51:47,SPEAKER 8, The closest thing.
1810,0:51:48,0:51:49,SPEAKER 3, You will get.
1811,0:51:49,0:51:50,BUFFETT, You don't have to spend time.
1812,0:51:51,0:51:52,SPEAKER 8, According analysts who.
1813,0:51:53,0:51:55,SPEAKER 3, You probably have contempt for.
1814,0:51:55,0:51:56,BUFFETT, In many cases.
1815,0:51:57,0:51:58,SPEAKER 3, You don't have to spend time with banks.
1816,0:51:59,0:51:59,SPEAKER 6, You know.
1817,0:52:00,0:52:01,BUFFETT, Getting money and.
1818,0:52:01,0:52:03,SPEAKER 8, Particularly in terrible times.
1819,0:52:03,0:52:07,BUFFETT, Yeah there's all kinds of.  You get a lot.  And the way of freedom.
1820,0:52:08,0:52:08,SPEAKER 1, That.
1821,0:52:09,0:52:11,SPEAKER 3, I would think would be meaningful.   To me.  And it might be better if you own the whole place yourself.
1822,0:52:16,0:52:16,SPEAKER 1, But.
1823,0:52:16,0:52:45,SPEAKER 3, I don't.   Maybe you've got siblings the one I'll maybe I'm there's a million reasons why you may not be able to achieve  money and it was worth many great many billions of dollars and Berkshire Hathaway wanted to buy it and shareholders were willing to vote it.
1824,0:52:58,0:53:00,SPEAKER 6, I would consider  it the way I would feel about life.
1825,0:53:04,0:53:27,SPEAKER 3, But one thing I wouldn't want to retire at 65 I'd want to keep working and we we just we there's there are reasons to solve.  Berkshire which Charlie and I in certain positions if we were on the other side would take the deal and and but it isn't for everybody trying.
1826,0:53:27,0:53:27,SPEAKER 1, I  think we have a pretty good one.  We've been very lucky in.  I  don't know.  It seems to be that most of the people who are going to end up the way we did.  They almost already know how to do it.
1827,0:53:51,0:53:57,SPEAKER 3, Well the most important purchase and retrospect that we may have made was national  indemnity not because specifically what it would have led to and Jack Ringwald controlled the company and  I know him and liked him and he knew me and once a year he'd get irritated when the  Nebraska Department insurance or somebody would come come around and said they always came around when the carbon  racetrack was open you know so they could I mean he had all these theories about why was a pain in the neck to be regulated and I and I told Charlie Hider next time Jack is in that mood where he's ready to sell this because he's tired of fooling around with all these guys.
1828,0:54:44,0:55:31,BUFFETT, Be sure and find him and I'm glad he's ready to go.  And so Charlie called me one day and he says Jack is in the heat and I said bring him over and we made a deal.  Well that's why Jack sold and he was happy after he made the deal and I was happy after we made the deal.  So there's a man that controlled the business but just decided these people didn't seem to bother him as much once they were my problem and not his and he just can't tell when lightning will strike and and that didn't do magnificence.  And things for us initially but just look at what it let do you know and then so you never you know if you know if you know how you were going to get if you know how you're going to shoot all 18 holes it wouldn't be any fun playing you wouldn't get on the first tee.  I mean it's  it's it's the it's the uncertainty the fun of playing the game the opposite all kinds of things that make a game interesting and and I think Charlie or I are in the most interesting game in the world.  Okay Becky.
1829,0:55:51,0:56:13,SPEAKER 1, Here's a question from Simon Withers in Perth in Western Australia.  It's been a long time since we've heard about C's candy and net jets.  Could you please give us an update on C's performance and when you project it will run out of places to open stores in the United States and could you also give us an overview of how net jets has performed since its acquisition and  whether it's achieved the potential you saw at the time of that acquisition.
1830,0:56:14,0:56:23,SPEAKER 3, Well.  With C's it hasn't been a question of opening stores we find out that we we've tried about with at this wonderful.
1831,0:56:25,0:56:27,SPEAKER 4, Ram that doesn't travel you know.
1832,0:56:28,0:56:43,BUFFETT, The mystique the actual product.  The feelings people have about some things as we said before I mean it sometimes is it's limited to give them Marcus Dr.
1833,0:56:44,0:56:44,SPEAKER 5, Pepper selves and then we'll see if we can get it.
1834,0:56:44,0:57:14,SPEAKER 3, I'm sure that we can get ourselves at a huge rate in Dallas Fort Worth and maybe I maybe 10 times the percentage per capita maybe that it has in Detroit or Boston and you say well how can that be with the product been around for century and people travel and you have national advertising and I'm not sure but I keep learning more as I watch different brands and Charlie and I are economics were so good in California that we tried to  get the product in the world.  In many cases the same experiment over and over again doesn't cost much the experiment we've tried everything in the world to cause a band brand to travel and we always think we were right for the first week and then we find out that that's the magic.  We can we can beat any other candy store pretty much but there aren't any candy stores.  The world has changed.
1835,0:57:41,0:57:41,SPEAKER 9, So.
1836,0:57:42,0:57:43,SPEAKER 6, Uh.
1837,0:57:43,0:57:43,SPEAKER 1, See if we can get the product to be able to get it.  Uh.
1838,0:57:44,0:57:49,SPEAKER 4, Seas is a 101 years now.
1839,0:57:50,0:58:09,SPEAKER 3, It has magic and it has limited magic and sort of the adjacent west.  You can almost as gravitational almost and and then uh you get to the east and incidentally in the east people prefer dark chocolate to them to melt chocolate in the west people prefer milk chocolate to dark.
1840,0:58:10,0:58:12,SPEAKER 8, The east thing saw miniatures in dark.
1841,0:58:13,0:58:13,SPEAKER 6, The west thing is a little bit more  than the west.
1842,0:58:13,0:58:43,SPEAKER 3, I mean there's all kinds of crazy things in the world that consumers do but you want to keep observing it because you do it on a level and with Charlie and I'm the the temptation to keep trying things because the economics were so good if we succeeded.  So we tried various things and of course every manager wants to try that comes along because they if one you know it should work but it doesn't work.  So.
1843,0:58:43,0:58:43,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1844,0:58:43,0:58:57,SPEAKER 3, But that's that's what makes it very interesting and yet yet's we we have really.  Learned how to distinguish.  Justifiably distinguish.
1845,0:58:59,0:58:59,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
1846,0:59:00,0:59:01,SPEAKER 5, A service.
1847,0:59:01,0:59:03,BUFFETT, The people saw that.
1848,0:59:04,0:59:04,SPEAKER 6, If you can.
1849,0:59:05,0:59:08,BUFFETT, You have to be very well to do.
1850,0:59:08,0:59:10,SPEAKER 5, To use it.
1851,0:59:10,0:59:13,BUFFETT, But if you're very well to do your in effect your.
1852,0:59:13,0:59:13,SPEAKER 1, In effect.
1853,0:59:13,0:59:13,SPEAKER 4, You're.
1854,0:59:13,0:59:14,SPEAKER 3, You're spending your errors.
1855,0:59:16,0:59:16,SPEAKER 6, Money.
1856,0:59:17,0:59:25,BUFFETT, Minutes what I told my analyst after she went from teaching to be worth millions and millions of dollars and she came to see me.  She never been married.
1857,0:59:25,0:59:30,SPEAKER 4, She said can I afford to buy this for a cold in 1968 or nine.
1858,0:59:30,0:59:42,SPEAKER 3, I said Alice you aren't buying it.  Your nieces and nephews are buying it because that's who you're leaving your money to speaking on behalf of your nieces and nephews.  I've said we want you to buy it and it's the same way.
1859,0:59:42,0:59:43,BUFFETT, You know do your error.
1860,0:59:43,0:59:53,SPEAKER 3, You want you to fly around and that's what you want to leave a little more money to your foundation or your kids and.  And what to sell that one is to offer your kids a few hours themselves.
1861,0:59:54,1:00:00,BUFFETT, Then their attitude can change.  So it's it's it's in a class by itself.
1862,1:00:01,1:00:05,SPEAKER 3, It's it's somewhat Ferrari is done in a different sort of way.
1863,1:00:06,1:00:06,BUFFETT, In cars.
1864,1:00:07,1:00:09,SPEAKER 3," Ferrari sells 11,000 cars here. "
1865,1:00:10,1:00:10,BUFFETT, I mean.
1866,1:00:11,1:00:22,SPEAKER 3," Maybe 12,000 and.  You know.  They're no one's throughout the world and will have a Chevy dealership in Austin or something will sell as many cars but we're in a Ferrari and that just. "
1867,1:00:24,1:00:28,BUFFETT," Has 600.  Well, the county Europe.  I mean it's maybe 650. "
1868,1:00:28,1:00:34,SPEAKER 3, But we're gonna buy a hundred planes this year.  We won't sell any because we got a backlog and we took.
1869,1:00:34,1:00:36,BUFFETT, We took a net jet.
1870,1:00:36,1:00:38,SPEAKER 5, Flight over to Tokyo and.
1871,1:00:38,1:00:43,SPEAKER 8, We arrived in.  Good shape and we spent a couple days there and we flew back.  And there's just nothing to it now.
1872,1:00:46,1:00:50,BUFFETT, You can say well.  You're getting sort of decked out in your old age.
1873,1:00:51,1:00:51,SPEAKER 9, But.
1874,1:00:52,1:00:54,BUFFETT, Money will go to.
1875,1:00:55,1:00:56,SPEAKER 8, The lines are being low.
1876,1:00:57,1:00:59,BUFFETT, Money will probably be 100 billion or more.
1877,1:00:59,1:01:00,SPEAKER 1, And.
1878,1:01:01,1:01:02,SPEAKER 3, I forget the florida piece.
1879,1:01:02,1:01:04,SPEAKER 5, Want me to spend a few bucks on myself.
1880,1:01:05,1:01:12,SPEAKER 3, It all has to do to be better than the last dollars that are spent by.  Various florida piece which have plenty of problems finding things to do to make.
1881,1:01:13,1:01:13,SPEAKER 1, I mean.  I mean.
1882,1:01:13,1:01:13,SPEAKER 3, We've got some sense.
1883,1:01:14,1:01:14,SPEAKER 1, So.
1884,1:01:15,1:01:16,BUFFETT, That's.
1885,1:01:17,1:01:18,SPEAKER 8, There is a competitor.
1886,1:01:18,1:01:19,BUFFETT, I mean we looked at.
1887,1:01:20,1:01:21,SPEAKER 6, The other day.
1888,1:01:22,1:01:23,SPEAKER 5, Wheels up.
1889,1:01:24,1:01:29,BUFFETT, Stock came out of $10.  A couple years ago.
1890,1:01:30,1:01:35,SPEAKER 3," Selling at 48 cents.  The other day and they got 12,600 people. "
1891,1:01:35,1:01:36,BUFFETT, They've given a bill.
1892,1:01:36,1:01:37,SPEAKER 8, A billion dollars.
1893,1:01:43,1:01:44,SPEAKER 4, Large where they.
1894,1:01:45,1:01:47,BUFFETT, They've given them money and they get a certain number of hours later on.
1895,1:01:48,1:01:48,SPEAKER 6, And.
1896,1:01:49,1:01:58,BUFFETT, They don't.  I think there's a good chance that some  people are going to be very disappointed later on when they have money to.
1897,1:01:59,1:02:00,SPEAKER 6, Do not get.
1898,1:02:00,1:02:00,SPEAKER 3, They.
1899,1:02:01,1:02:06,BUFFETT, They know well get.  They'll get on the same planes with the same pilots.
1900,1:02:07,1:02:07,SPEAKER 1, As
1901,1:02:08,1:02:09,BUFFETT, I am my family.
1902,1:02:09,1:02:13,SPEAKER 3, Have flown on since before we bought the company.
1903,1:02:13,1:02:16,BUFFETT, So it's not it's not shaped by.
1904,1:02:16,1:02:19,SPEAKER 3, Was this decision was shaped by some commercial.
1905,1:02:20,1:02:25,BUFFETT, Objective.  Couple years before.  I never heard of that.
1906,1:02:25,1:02:26,SPEAKER 6, Just some.
1907,1:02:26,1:02:30,BUFFETT, Frank Rooney mentioned it to me and.  I bought share share immediately.   And.  And we bought the company and.
1908,1:02:34,1:02:34,SPEAKER 1, And.
1909,1:02:36,1:02:36,BUFFETT, Every.
1910,1:02:38,1:02:38,SPEAKER 3, Well.
1911,1:02:39,1:02:40,SPEAKER 5, My kids have to fight commercial.
1912,1:02:40,1:02:43,BUFFETT, Sometimes they get to use hours too.
1913,1:02:43,1:02:43,SPEAKER 6, But.
1914,1:02:44,1:02:48,SPEAKER 3, I've never thought anything else and why would I mean it's  it's it's the gold center and.
1915,1:02:53,1:02:54,SPEAKER 8, Nobody will.
1916,1:02:56,1:02:57,BUFFETT, Match our fleet.
1917,1:02:57,1:02:58,SPEAKER 6, I mean if you've got.  That.
1918,1:02:59,1:03:05,BUFFETT, Six hundred planes you've got them all more places in the United States than.  Anybody else will have theirs.
1919,1:03:05,1:03:07,SPEAKER 3, I think with the second largest.
1920,1:03:07,1:03:08,BUFFETT, The commercial.
1921,1:03:08,1:03:09,SPEAKER 3, And.  And our fleet's growing like I say.
1922,1:03:11,1:03:18,BUFFETT, The rate of.  It's a.  It's a marvelous company and.
1923,1:03:19,1:03:19,SPEAKER 3, Adam Johnson.
1924,1:03:20,1:03:21,BUFFETT, Performed.
1925,1:03:24,1:03:24,SPEAKER 1, It.
1926,1:03:25,1:03:27,SPEAKER 3, You just can't believe what he's done.
1927,1:03:28,1:03:33,SPEAKER 4, With the business and it was a tough model for a long time.
1928,1:03:34,1:03:36,BUFFETT, But he's bought it where it is and we've got.
1929,1:03:37,1:03:38,SPEAKER 5, We should.
1930,1:03:38,1:03:40,BUFFETT, Have a wonderful company for.
1931,1:03:41,1:03:41,SPEAKER 3, Forever.
1932,1:03:43,1:03:43,SPEAKER 6, Charlie.
1933,1:03:45,1:03:52,SPEAKER 4, Well that's been remarkable.  You can argue that it's worth as much as any airline.
1934,1:03:52,1:03:55,SPEAKER 3, It's so different.  And Charlie we had a hard time selling Charlie and that just membership.  And then we figured the way to get him.  To buy a membership was to put a coach seat.
1935,1:04:06,1:04:06,BUFFETT, In the.
1936,1:04:07,1:04:07,SPEAKER 1, The.
1937,1:04:07,1:04:11,BUFFETT, That really knocked him off.
1938,1:04:11,1:04:11,SPEAKER 5, I mean.
1939,1:04:13,1:04:16,BUFFETT, I think he's the only one we saw on the basis of I used to come to the.
1940,1:04:17,1:04:22,SPEAKER 4, Virtual annual.  Beings on coach.  From Los Angeles.  And it was full of rich.   Stockholders.  And they would clap when I came into the coach section.  I really like that.
1941,1:04:32,1:04:41,BUFFETT, But I gotta tell you we some I corrupted him.
1942,1:04:42,1:04:42,SPEAKER 1, I.
1943,1:04:42,1:04:44,SPEAKER 4, Hey.  Hey.
1944,1:04:45,1:04:46,SPEAKER 1, He.  He.  He.
1945,1:04:46,1:04:53,BUFFETT, He feels he kind of has to explain it but he so flies at that.  And it'd be crazy not to.
1946,1:04:54,1:04:54,SPEAKER 3, You know.
1947,1:04:54,1:04:54,SPEAKER 1, It's.
1948,1:04:54,1:04:59,BUFFETT, Your errors are paying for it.  I mean if I be anybody.
1949,1:05:00,1:05:00,SPEAKER 5, Who's the state.
1950,1:05:00,1:05:02,SPEAKER 6, I mean.
1951,1:05:02,1:05:06,SPEAKER 3, Less than zero because what they spent in.  On that.  Through  a minute of that position.
1952,1:05:09,1:05:10,BUFFETT, Let me know.
1953,1:05:10,1:05:10,SPEAKER 5, But I've.
1954,1:05:11,1:05:13,SPEAKER 3, I've never seen a case yet.   It won't be the case for the buffet.  And it's the residual.
1955,1:05:17,1:05:19,SPEAKER 8, Bottom beneficiary that's paying.
1956,1:05:20,1:05:22,BUFFETT, For your.
1957,1:05:22,1:05:23,SPEAKER 4, Your membership.
1958,1:05:24,1:05:24,SPEAKER 1, And.
1959,1:05:25,1:05:28,SPEAKER 3, It's a little hard to get used to paying that much money.

1968,1:06:00,1:06:23,SPEAKER 1, Each year.  Looking at the global.  Trends it increasingly does seem that zero mission vehicles may have finally reached the cusp of mass adoption.  Do you see any opportunities in this space.  Either in specific vehicle manufacturers or in related technologies.

2028,1:08:28,1:08:41,SPEAKER 3," Well, you've got a lot of worldwide competitors.  They're not going to go away and they're look like it looks like there are winners at any given time,  but it doesn't get to a permanent place. "
2029,1:08:41,1:08:45,SPEAKER 8," Although, as I mentioned, I would say Ferrari is in a special place,  but I only saw 11 or 12"
2030,1:08:47,1:08:53,SPEAKER 4,",000 cars a year and US last year,  I think there were 14 million something and."
2031,1:08:59,1:09:04,SPEAKER 3," It's not a business where we find it fascinating to be in.  We like our dealership operation, but "
2032,1:09:06,1:09:10,BUFFETT, I don't think I can tell you what the auto industry will look at.  Look like five or 10 years now.
2033,1:09:10,1:09:11,SPEAKER 3, I do think that you're right.
2034,1:09:12,1:09:12,SPEAKER 1, That.
2035,1:09:13,1:09:13,SPEAKER 6, That.
2036,1:09:14,1:09:14,SPEAKER 3," You know,  there's a you will see a change in the vehicles, but you won't see anybody that owns the market because they changed the vehicle."
2037,1:09:22,1:09:22,SPEAKER 6, Charlie.
2038,1:09:24,1:09:32,SPEAKER 4," Well, the electric vehicles coming big time.  And that's a very interesting development at  the moment. "
2039,1:09:42,1:09:42,SPEAKER 3,"It's  imposing huge capital costs and huge risks.  And I don't like huge capital costs and you. And we're subsidizing in the United States and we're actually doing it,  trying putting it a pro labor time.  I mean, it is subject to politics like you can't believe to, but it's going to be with us.  We're not going to quit.  We're driving cars and American public has a love affair with them. "
2040,1:10:02,1:10:03,BUFFETT, But.
2041,1:10:05,1:10:05,SPEAKER 1, I.
2042,1:10:06,1:10:15,BUFFETT," I think I know.  Where Apple is going to be in five or 10 years and I don't know what the car companies are going to be in five or 10 years.  And I may be wrong, but that's. "
2043,1:10:15,1:10:15,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
2044,1:10:18,1:10:18,SPEAKER 5, We.
2045,1:10:19,1:10:24,BUFFETT, Charlie enough.  Follow the auto business with.  With intense interest.
2046,1:10:25,1:10:28,SPEAKER 8, Charlie's firm.  Was the specialist in general.
2047,1:10:28,1:10:32,SPEAKER 3, Motors on the Pacific Coast stock exchange and that was that was a franchise.  Wouldn't it?
2048,1:10:32,1:10:32,SPEAKER 1, Charlie.
2049,1:10:33,1:10:37,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, we get by working very hard.  We can make a minor or a minor money. "
2050,1:10:38,1:10:39,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.
2051,1:10:39,1:10:40,BUFFETT, Wasn't minor at the time.
2052,1:10:41,1:10:42,SPEAKER 1, No.  But.
2053,1:10:42,1:10:45,SPEAKER 4, Was it my earth?  The time even.  You know.
2054,1:10:45,1:10:48,BUFFETT," Well, that was pretty minor.  Okay. "
2055,1:10:48,1:10:49,SPEAKER 6, Becky.
2056,1:10:49,1:11:01,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from Lindsay Peter Schumacher in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Does the current size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet?  No,  but the Charge Act.  What my 401.  mad and embodiments then at the stock  meet up a 100 percentCR showcase is the lens and they have to use it for one  reason.  Consumers can take a cut out at the events that have a different  price from the big-azy technology budget.  energy question.  And I'm wondering what Mr.  Munger thinks about this as well. "
2057,1:11:19,1:11:24,SPEAKER 3," Well, I don't think the Federal Reserve is the problem and I think they can't solve the  fiscal problem.  And I don't.  I do not worry about the Federal Reserve and I think it's fulfilling the functions for which it was established. "
2058,1:11:39,1:11:41,SPEAKER 4, I probably would not have been.
2059,1:11:42,1:11:45,SPEAKER 3, They only they have two objectives and I would not have been.
2060,1:11:45,1:11:51,SPEAKER 4," One  probably that would have changed the inflation objective to 2 percent a year from from  zero.  I think that.  You know, I think."
2061,1:11:59,1:12:10,SPEAKER 3," That if you tell you people that you're shooting to depreciate your currency at 2 percent a year.  That is.  A lot of implications,  although it feels good to a lot of people want a little inflation.  But nobody wants a lot of inflation except somebody's got lots of deaths and. "
2062,1:12:22,1:12:25,SPEAKER 6, I.
2063,1:12:26,1:12:26,SPEAKER 1, I.
2064,1:12:26,1:12:29,SPEAKER 3, I do not worry about the Federal Reserve balance sheet.
2065,1:12:30,1:12:33,SPEAKER 8, I'll enjoy looking at it and the numbers are big.
2066,1:12:33,1:12:34,BUFFETT, I always like big numbers.
2067,1:12:34,1:12:34,SPEAKER 6, But but.
2068,1:12:36,1:12:37,BUFFETT, It is not.
2069,1:12:38,1:12:39,SPEAKER 1, It's interesting.
2070,1:12:39,1:12:40,SPEAKER 3, The most one one.
2071,1:12:40,1:12:43,SPEAKER 8, The most interesting figures to me.  It's currency in circulation.
2072,1:12:43,1:12:44,BUFFETT, I mean.
2073,1:12:45,1:12:45,SPEAKER 1, It's not.  You know.  I see.  All the other.  So I mean.
2074,1:12:45,1:12:45,SPEAKER 9, It is gone.
2075,1:12:46,1:12:48,SPEAKER 8, They were saying cash is trash back in 2008.
2076,1:12:49,1:12:50,BUFFETT, Seven and eight.
2077,1:12:50,1:12:52,SPEAKER 5, All that cash is going to disappear.
2078,1:12:52,1:12:52,SPEAKER 9, Well.
2079,1:12:52,1:12:55,SPEAKER 3," If you look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet,  it's gone from 800 billion to 2.2 trillion. And most of us in $100 bills overwhelmingly. And if you're not, I think there's about $5 ,100 bills per person.  Babies everybody in the United States. "
2080,1:13:10,1:13:10,SPEAKER 1, And.
2081,1:13:10,1:13:13,SPEAKER 3, I would really like to know where.
2082,1:13:13,1:13:15,SPEAKER 6, All of that.
2083,1:13:15,1:13:15,SPEAKER 3, That is.
2084,1:13:15,1:13:16,SPEAKER 6," I mean, it's. "
2085,1:13:16,1:13:19,SPEAKER 3, Nobody's hoarding your dollars.
2086,1:13:19,1:13:22,SPEAKER 8," You know, in South America,  Africa or wherever.  And the demand for currency."
2087,1:13:26,1:13:26,SPEAKER 1, Now.
2088,1:13:27,1:13:30,BUFFETT," You know, it's.  Some of the use of the. "
2089,1:13:30,1:13:30,SPEAKER 1, So.
2090,1:13:31,1:13:35,BUFFETT, So drug dealers.  Activities and all of that.
2091,1:13:35,1:13:35,SPEAKER 1, But.
2092,1:13:36,1:13:37,BUFFETT, Anybody thinks cash is trash.
2093,1:13:39,1:13:39,SPEAKER 4, Auto.
2094,1:13:40,1:13:41,SPEAKER 6, Look at the.
2095,1:13:41,1:13:43,SPEAKER 3, Look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet.  And actually.  You can look at how many five dollar bills and two dollar bills and.  Once and all that.  And the action has been in one in one hundred dollar bills.
2096,1:13:53,1:13:53,SPEAKER 8," I mean, it is. "
2097,1:13:54,1:13:55,BUFFETT, It is just astounding.
2098,1:13:56,1:13:57,SPEAKER 3, The way that.
2099,1:13:57,1:13:59,BUFFETT," Hundred dollar bills have spread.  And of course, we don't know where I don't know where they are.  And I don't think the Fed can know exactly,  but they probably make it up better.  Yes.  And I could."
2100,1:14:08,1:14:11,SPEAKER 6, But I do know what's happened.  And you can watch it every week.  And you'll watch currency in circulation. And you'll see that.
2101,1:14:15,1:14:16,SPEAKER 3, Probably grow a little bit.
2102,1:14:17,1:14:17,BUFFETT," And.  And believe me, cash is not trash.  Charlie."
2103,1:14:25,1:14:25,SPEAKER 6," Well,  I don't know where we're headed with all of this.  It's been very extreme.  I think that you could be pretty extreme and fighting.  Depressions and so forth.  If you were version of that.  And  you can see it. And you can see it."
2104,1:15:03,1:15:25,SPEAKER 4," Latin America Latin America.  Let us currency get all the control all the time.  And of course, it's like the United States and you get all make achievement greatly.  So I think we pay a price if we.  If we ever give up our old ways entirely.  And go into a new world where we just try and print money.  This make it easier to get to get through the air. "
2105,1:15:27,1:15:31,SPEAKER 3, We paid a price in World War two.
2106,1:15:32,1:15:33,BUFFETT," I mean, everybody. "
2107,1:15:33,1:15:36,SPEAKER 3, School kids and everybody else myself included.
2108,1:15:37,1:15:37,SPEAKER 6, I'm with.
2109,1:15:38,1:15:39,BUFFETT, We bought what we're originally called.
2110,1:15:40,1:15:43,SPEAKER 3, War bonds and defense bonds and savings bonds and all that.
2111,1:15:44,1:15:44,SPEAKER 1, But.
2112,1:15:44,1:15:44,SPEAKER 6, But.
2113,1:15:44,1:15:46,SPEAKER 1, From 1940.
2114,1:15:48,1:15:49,SPEAKER 3, To the 1944 or five.
2115,1:15:50,1:15:54,BUFFETT, You paid out of 1875.  I got $25 back and every kid.
2116,1:15:55,1:15:56,SPEAKER 3, Save savings and all that.
2117,1:15:56,1:15:59,BUFFETT," But when you got all through.  You know,  you had. 120% of GDP in the national debt instead of 30 or 40%. And we had a lot of inflation."
2118,1:16:11,1:16:12,SPEAKER 3," Subsequently,  a lot."
2119,1:16:13,1:16:14,SPEAKER 5, So the people.
2120,1:16:14,1:16:22,SPEAKER 3, That really that bought those bonds and support the war.  Had a portion of their purchasing power taken away from them.
2121,1:16:22,1:16:24,BUFFETT," Well, there wasn't any wrong with that particularly. "
2122,1:16:25,1:16:25,SPEAKER 4, But.
2123,1:16:26,1:16:32,BUFFETT, When the country gets in the habit of doing that.  I don't think it's.
2124,1:16:32,1:16:38,SPEAKER 3, I think it's tough to.  To figure out where the breaking point is with society.
2125,1:16:38,1:16:40,SPEAKER 8, But I don't think it wanted to come anywhere close to it.
2126,1:16:40,1:16:45,SPEAKER 4, It's also tough to have a mass of people unemployed.  That's the tension.
2127,1:16:47,1:16:49,SPEAKER 6," Yeah.  Well, that's. "
2128,1:16:49,1:16:53,BUFFETT, That's why the.  That has to.
2129,1:16:53,1:16:57,SPEAKER 3, Objectives in terms of employment and inflation and.
2130,1:16:59,1:16:59,SPEAKER 6, But.
2131,1:17:00,1:17:02,BUFFETT, They're not the ones that.  That created us.
2132,1:17:03,1:17:04,SPEAKER 5," So far, the system.  And work pretty well,  although like I say, it's been so far."
2133,1:17:09,1:17:11,SPEAKER 4, The man who jumped off a tall building.
2134,1:17:11,1:17:12,SPEAKER 9," Yeah, it's over. "
2135,1:17:12,1:17:14,SPEAKER 4, Till he hits the ground.  Yeah.
2136,1:17:14,1:17:14,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Right.
2137,1:17:15,1:17:23,SPEAKER 3," Well,  but.  But you could be ways we can stop now at the Third floor or the Sixth floor.  We don't know what forward is,  but we know what is happening to the ground. "
2138,1:17:24,1:17:25,BUFFETT, But the question.
2139,1:17:27,1:17:30,SPEAKER 3," You know, politically, it's very, very, very tempting. "
2140,1:17:31,1:17:31,SPEAKER 1, To.
2141,1:17:32,1:17:32,SPEAKER 3, To vote.
2142,1:17:33,1:17:37,SPEAKER 5," Appropriations, and it's not fun to.  Both taxes and. "
2143,1:17:38,1:17:38,SPEAKER 3, Russell long.
2144,1:17:39,1:17:42,BUFFETT," Have the Senate finance committee.  They got a building they have from now.  He said, you know,  Don't tax you.  Don't tax me."
2145,1:17:44,1:17:44,SPEAKER 1, You don't tax me.
2146,1:17:44,1:17:46,SPEAKER 8, They may tax like our behind the tree.
2147,1:17:47,1:17:47,SPEAKER 1," Basically,  that is the attitude of."
2148,1:17:51,1:18:00,SPEAKER 8," I mean, it's the reality of what is useful.  In politics and so far,  this country's managed to.  Work very well with a lot of things that. "
2149,1:18:07,1:18:10,BUFFETT," Could theoretically cause a lot of problems,  but it doesn't mean it doesn't guarantee us the future on it and.  And being the reserve currency."
2150,1:18:19,1:18:22,SPEAKER 5," Let's just do a lot of things,  but it also creates a lot of consequences. "
2151,1:18:22,1:18:24,SPEAKER 3, If we screw it up.
2152,1:18:26,1:18:26,SPEAKER 4, Really?
2153,1:18:28,1:18:28,SPEAKER 3, Well.
2154,1:18:30,1:18:36,SPEAKER 4," We're bidding a subject to death, but.  It is a problem.  I wish we had a solution. "
2155,1:18:38,1:18:39,SPEAKER 5," Okay, well, that will go to station one. "
2156,1:18:45,1:18:45,SPEAKER 9," Hello,  Mr.  Buffett and Mr.  Munger. "
2157,1:18:49,1:19:12,SPEAKER 1," My name is Connor.  I'm an economic student to the University of Nottingham.  My question for you today.  Is during the pandemic,  we witnessed supply chain shortages, especially from Asia.  As a result,  companies have chosen with political attention to  move production away.  Should companies make these decisions and should the government support them? "
2158,1:19:15,1:19:15,SPEAKER 8, Trying?
2159,1:19:16,1:19:17,SPEAKER 4," Well, that's a good question. "
2160,1:19:17,1:19:17,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
2161,1:19:18,1:19:51,SPEAKER 4," Obviously.  It's logical.  If you're in business and you can make the thing in Mexico way cheaper.  It's natural to open a factory in Mexico and.  Get your parts cheaper and one of the older ones.  The more manufacturers have done exactly that.  On the other hand.  Nobody wants to hollow out the whole country.  So all the manufacturing jobs are elsewhere and we're all living with a bunch of farmers.  You know,  like English colonies in 1820 or something.   And.  And these ideas that are of course in.  And big tension."
2162,1:20:03,1:20:05,SPEAKER 1, Uh.  We have.
2163,1:20:06,1:20:10,SPEAKER 4, We don't have that much foreign production.
2164,1:20:12,1:20:12,SPEAKER 1, Right Warren.
2165,1:20:13,1:20:26,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, well.  But we've lost.  Well,  originally Berkshire, otherwise, the textile manufacturing loss because the south became feasible versus the north and of course then eventually. "
2166,1:20:27,1:20:27,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  the south got expensive.  Sure.  And. "
2167,1:20:33,1:20:33,SPEAKER 4, Uh.
2168,1:20:34,1:20:34,BUFFETT," Uh.  Uh.  Uh,  society benefits and some people get killed in that sort of a situation and a rich society should take care one way or another. And of."
2169,1:20:48,1:20:49,SPEAKER 8, People who worked in our shoe factories.
2170,1:20:50,1:20:52,SPEAKER 3, People working our textile companies.
2171,1:20:52,1:20:53,SPEAKER 6," I mean,  if you worked in our textile operation in.  In 1964 when we took it over half our."
2172,1:21:01,1:21:03,SPEAKER 8, Half our workers only spoke Portuguese.
2173,1:21:03,1:21:04,SPEAKER 5, And.
2174,1:21:04,1:21:19,SPEAKER 3," Uh, you know, they weren't getting great wages at all.  But now you could do it in the south and we were doomed to go out of business.  And it wasn't the fall of the worker in any way, shape or form. "
2175,1:21:20,1:21:20,BUFFETT, It wasn't the.
2176,1:21:21,1:21:21,SPEAKER 5, Our fault.
2177,1:21:22,1:21:23,BUFFETT, We kept trying to compete.
2178,1:21:24,1:21:27,SPEAKER 4," Well, it was a TV.  I had cheap power down there. "
2179,1:21:27,1:21:28,SPEAKER 1, Sure.  And a.
2180,1:21:29,1:21:34,SPEAKER 3, Textile is really can jail power and air conditioning change everything with the heat and those.
2181,1:21:34,1:21:34,SPEAKER 1, Um.  And then the.
2182,1:21:35,1:21:36,SPEAKER 8, Pleasures were impossible.
2183,1:21:36,1:21:39,BUFFETT," That's a lot of things,  but then then it moves. "
2184,1:21:40,1:21:40,SPEAKER 4," Uh,  offshore in many ways and."
2185,1:21:44,1:21:45,SPEAKER 1, And.  Net.
2186,1:21:46,1:21:51,SPEAKER 3," The country is better off because of it,  but it displaces a lot of people.   Really can't do something else.  And like it can't talk about retraining somebody that's 55 or 16 speaks only Portuguese and really tell them they're going to have a great future and no bed for mass and."
2187,1:22:01,1:22:02,BUFFETT," You know, and. "
2188,1:22:02,1:22:02,SPEAKER 3, And.
2189,1:22:04,1:22:06,SPEAKER 4," You know, you don't want to be glib about it. "
2190,1:22:07,1:22:07,SPEAKER 3," Uh,  and we can afford.  To take care of those people.  And we've got some systems that work reasonably well, but there's a tension between."
2191,1:22:18,1:22:18,SPEAKER 4," You know,  what about the person that doesn't do anything and all that kind of stuff?"
2192,1:22:22,1:22:26,BUFFETT, These are not easy problems to solve.  But I would say.
2193,1:22:27,1:22:30,SPEAKER 8," That by and large,  we want the whole world to prosper. "
2194,1:22:30,1:22:34,BUFFETT, We do not want to be a world.  We don't want the United States.
2195,1:22:34,1:22:38,SPEAKER 3," But we want the world to be a country of extraordinary prosperity and have the rest of the world.   No,  it isn't going to work and particularly it's going to work in a nuclear world.  So. And you have your own feelings about it as a humane person, but it doesn't.  It is not.  It can be done better. And we've got the resources to do it."
2196,1:23:01,1:23:02,BUFFETT," I mean, it isn't. "
2197,1:23:02,1:23:02,SPEAKER 1, The.
2198,1:23:03,1:23:03,SPEAKER 6, I'll.
2199,1:23:03,1:23:13,SPEAKER 3, The output of this country.  What can be done with a lot fewer people and doing more specialized things.  And of course it has been the work week in the United States.
2200,1:23:14,1:23:15,SPEAKER 8," You know, in my lifetime is  dropped dramatically and people.  So feel busy and."
2201,1:23:20,1:23:26,SPEAKER 3," It will be the human lot to say,  you know, how can I get all these things done? "
2202,1:23:26,1:23:27,SPEAKER 1, But.  But.
2203,1:23:28,1:23:30,SPEAKER 3, My mother didn't drive for kids anyplace.   I do want to go in a place.  If you're lucky.  And we got old enough yet a bicycle that the world just keeps looking at everything moving up as becoming sort of a base that leaves them somewhat dissatisfied.
2204,1:23:43,1:23:43,SPEAKER 1, And.
2205,1:23:45,1:23:47,SPEAKER 4, With our prosperity.
2206,1:23:48,1:23:52,SPEAKER 8, We can do a lot of things we couldn't do in.
2207,1:23:53,1:23:57,BUFFETT, In 1930 and including.  Taking care of people that get.
2208,1:23:58,1:23:59,SPEAKER 1, Get.
2209,1:24:00,1:24:00,SPEAKER 3, Displaced.
2210,1:24:01,1:24:02,BUFFETT, By the fact that.
2211,1:24:02,1:24:03,SPEAKER 3, Some.
2212,1:24:03,1:24:04,BUFFETT, Somebody else can do that work and.  And improve their lot in life. And we got to make sure that.
2213,1:24:10,1:24:11,SPEAKER 3, We have the best system.
2214,1:24:11,1:24:12,BUFFETT, It takes care of the people who.
2215,1:24:13,1:24:15,SPEAKER 6," Who get displaced by that, but. "
2216,1:24:17,1:24:17,BUFFETT, Doing that.
2217,1:24:18,1:24:18,SPEAKER 6, And.
2218,1:24:18,1:24:22,SPEAKER 4," The system we have and everything.  We'll make a lot of mistakes along the way,  but we got to keep moving in that direction. And I think the interesting thing about it is the.  Adam Smith was right that the."
2219,1:24:32,1:24:32,SPEAKER 1, The.
2220,1:24:33,1:24:52,SPEAKER 4," Free market capitalism.  Automatically with a lot of property and private hands and free trade and all that automatically.  Creates GDP per capita that grows and helps everybody,  including the people at the bottom.  Helps everybody a lot. "
2221,1:24:53,1:24:53,SPEAKER 3, But.
2222,1:24:54,1:25:31,SPEAKER 4," In here in the process.  There's a lot of pain in that free market capitalism, for instance,  to the Portuguese workers in the textbook company in New Bedford.  And nobody's ever figured out how to take all the pain out of it.  We do have government safety nets to take some of the pain out.  We make those safety nets a little bigger as time goes by.  But apart from that.  If you try to take all the pain out,  you'll also take all the gains out of it.  You won't have it growing GDP per capita.  You'll have an economy like Russia's, which.  It's been characterized as saying they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. "
2223,1:25:32,1:25:33,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Yeah.
2224,1:25:34,1:25:35,SPEAKER 3," The other systems haven't worked better,  but yeah, it also produces more and more disparities.  In wealth and people that."
2225,1:25:44,1:25:45,SPEAKER 6, Do nothing but.
2226,1:25:46,1:25:51,SPEAKER 3, Get assets under management without actually performing anything extra.  Make fortunes and I mean.
2227,1:25:51,1:25:52,SPEAKER 1, It.
2228,1:25:53,1:25:53,SPEAKER 3, It's.
2229,1:25:54,1:25:56,SPEAKER 8, It's a job of government to keep the  best aspects of  capitalism while not.  Causing people that.
2230,1:26:01,1:26:04,SPEAKER 3, Only speak Portuguese.  To suffer in the process.
2231,1:26:04,1:26:05,SPEAKER 9," I mean,  two aren't compatible politically over time.  And.  We stumble along making progress on things like Social Security and all that."
2232,1:26:13,1:26:13,SPEAKER 4, And.  And.
2233,1:26:14,1:26:17,SPEAKER 3, We are a lot better off than we are when I was born.
2234,1:26:18,1:26:29,SPEAKER 4, Net the United States has done a very good job of this tension between.  Capitalistic growth and growing safe social.  We can be pretty proud of our country looking back.
2235,1:26:29,1:26:29,SPEAKER 3," Yeah.  And maybe why we have 25% of the world's GDP starting with a half a percent of the population and the few centuries.  I mean, it's just it's a miracle.  It wasn't because we're smarter.  Oh, you got to say that there must be something to the system."
2236,1:26:46,1:26:46,BUFFETT, It's worked.
2237,1:26:47,1:26:50,SPEAKER 6," Pretty well, even those produce the civil war and all kinds of things, you know,  and women."
2238,1:26:51,1:26:57,BUFFETT," You know, not getting a shot at anything,  you know, even after they passed the.  The 19th amendment. "
2239,1:26:59,1:26:59,SPEAKER 6, It's.
2240,1:27:00,1:27:00,SPEAKER 1, It's.
2241,1:27:02,1:27:03,SPEAKER 8, It's a work in progress.
2242,1:27:04,1:27:05,BUFFETT," I think actually there's been progress,  but it's mankind's nature to.  To see the see the things wrong with it. "
2243,1:27:13,1:27:13,SPEAKER 6, If you've.
2244,1:27:14,1:27:15,SPEAKER 1, It's even worse.
2245,1:27:15,1:27:32,SPEAKER 4, It's advanced nature to take the progress as a right.  Not something to be earned or strive for.  But something that should automatically just flow in over the trans.  And that attitude is rock is poison.  It doesn't do anybody any good.
2246,1:27:34,1:27:34,BUFFETT, Okay.
2247,1:27:34,1:27:36,SPEAKER 3," Now I ask a certain easy question, Becky. "
2248,1:27:37,1:27:38,SPEAKER 4," This  question comes from Doug DeSheel.  Since the accounting rules changed,  requiring Berkshire to report the change in fair value of its equity investments through the income statement."
2249,1:27:50,1:27:50,SPEAKER 9, Mr.
2250,1:27:50,1:28:11,SPEAKER 1," Buffett has repeatedly told shareholders to ignore those changes as they're not reflective of the long term returns that those investments will produce.  Recently, Mr.  Buffett.  He has argued that holds a maturity accounting used by the banks to avoid reflecting the changes in fair value of bank investment portfolios in the income statement and the shareholder equity account.  Do a disservice to its various stakeholders. "
2251,1:28:12,1:28:12,SPEAKER 9, Mr.
2252,1:28:13,1:28:17,SPEAKER 1, Buffett elaborate on why he views market accounting differently for banks in comparison to Berkshire.
2253,1:28:18,1:28:41,SPEAKER 3," Oh, I believe in both cases in doing it on the battle sheet and not in the income statement.  And it's a very tough problem with the auditor's face is that the.  Obviously, the income statement feeds into the balance sheet.  But the balance sheet tells you whether deposits can be paid.   It tells you a lot of things.  And we show it on our balance sheet.  We believe in showing market values on our balance sheet."
2254,1:28:48,1:28:50,BUFFETT, We just don't believe in running it for the income account.
2255,1:28:50,1:28:51,SPEAKER 8," And.  And in getting there, we would put it in other comprehensive income like it was for a long time."
2256,1:28:57,1:28:57,BUFFETT, So I.
2257,1:28:58,1:29:04,SPEAKER 3," I sympathize to some extent with the.  Oh, I'm far extent with the. "
2258,1:29:05,1:29:09,BUFFETT," All the group, but they have to really decide whether they want to. "
2259,1:29:09,1:29:11,SPEAKER 8, They want the balance sheet.
2260,1:29:11,1:29:17,SPEAKER 3, To represent values except it doesn't reflect them on the upside.
2261,1:29:17,1:29:19,BUFFETT," If we buy a seized can,  it's worth way more money. "
2262,1:29:19,1:29:22,SPEAKER 8, So it's conservative and that's.  But.
2263,1:29:23,1:29:29,BUFFETT, Whether they want to have a.  An income account that becomes meaningless to people.
2264,1:29:30,1:29:32,SPEAKER 3, Because it really changes every five seconds.
2265,1:29:32,1:29:33,BUFFETT," I mean, while we're. "
2266,1:29:34,1:29:36,SPEAKER 8," Market's closed today, but. "
2267,1:29:36,1:29:37,SPEAKER 1, But.
2268,1:29:37,1:29:39,SPEAKER 3," You know, we have days. "
2269,1:29:40,1:29:40,SPEAKER 6," Well,  I guess Apple was up what."
2270,1:29:43,1:29:44,SPEAKER 3, Some right points.
2271,1:29:44,1:29:45,BUFFETT, Some on Friday.
2272,1:29:45,1:29:46,SPEAKER 3," I mean, that's. "
2273,1:29:47,1:29:48,BUFFETT, Seven billion dollars.
2274,1:29:48,1:29:48,SPEAKER 3," I mean, didn't. "
2275,1:29:49,1:29:50,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Uh.
2276,1:29:51,1:29:52,BUFFETT," That's a crazy income account.   It is a reflection of where we stand at that point.  And of course, if you're a bank.  We're putting out money, really."
2277,1:30:00,1:30:01,SPEAKER 8, Things that.
2278,1:30:01,1:30:03,SPEAKER 3, People sort of mortgages.
2279,1:30:04,1:30:05,BUFFETT," I mean, primarily. "
2280,1:30:05,1:30:05,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
2281,1:30:07,1:30:18,SPEAKER 3, There are terrible instrument for a bank to own.  But a great instrument for a.  Consumer to buy.  And build in the whole society now in a way that was entirely different than the past.
2282,1:30:19,1:30:19,SPEAKER 6, Uh.
2283,1:30:20,1:30:22,SPEAKER 3, You've got a.  Pay attention to whether.
2284,1:30:23,1:30:25,BUFFETT, Whether they've gotten out of whack in terms of.
2285,1:30:26,1:30:26,SPEAKER 6, Of.
2286,1:30:27,1:30:36,SPEAKER 3," What's the value of what they own and what can be demanded out tomorrow morning.  If we had all of our money that could be demanded from us tomorrow morning,  we'd have to behave a lot differently than."
2287,1:30:39,1:30:40,SPEAKER 8, Then Berkshire does.
2288,1:30:40,1:30:43,BUFFETT, So I.  I don't.
2289,1:30:43,1:30:43,SPEAKER 3, I don't.
2290,1:30:44,1:30:48,BUFFETT, I really think the way to do it is the way.
2291,1:30:48,1:30:51,SPEAKER 8," You recommend doing, which is exactly. "
2292,1:30:51,1:30:56,SPEAKER 5," What was being done until a few years ago.  I recommend the shareholders look at it that way,  but we're going to follow the rules.  Obviously, the.  The SEC. "
2293,1:31:00,1:31:00,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
2294,1:31:01,1:31:03,SPEAKER 3," You know, state authorities and everybody. "
2295,1:31:03,1:31:08,SPEAKER 8," Uh, require us.  But I'll still explain to the shareholders exact. "
2296,1:31:08,1:31:10,SPEAKER 5, But I would explain to my sister.
2297,1:31:10,1:31:15,SPEAKER 3, About what really counts at Berkshire.  And I think every management actually has.
2298,1:31:15,1:31:18,SPEAKER 8, An obligation to that instead of it.
2299,1:31:19,1:31:21,BUFFETT, They go in the other direction and give them a lot of.
2300,1:31:21,1:31:22,SPEAKER 3, So a lot of the workers that are total nonsense.
2301,1:31:23,1:31:24,SPEAKER 8, You know I can't imagine.
2302,1:31:25,1:31:26,BUFFETT, Some of them.
2303,1:31:26,1:31:27,SPEAKER 3, You know even dye.
2304,1:31:28,1:31:29,BUFFETT," Thought was about as bad as you can get,  but they kept going in earnings before everything.  Uh, he be."
2305,1:31:35,1:31:35,SPEAKER 5," Uh,  and so."
2306,1:31:37,1:31:39,SPEAKER 1, Uh.  Uh.
2307,1:31:39,1:31:40,SPEAKER 5, But that doesn't change.
2308,1:31:40,1:31:43,SPEAKER 3, But I would tell my sister was here in the audience.
2309,1:31:43,1:31:43,SPEAKER 4, I hope.
2310,1:31:44,1:31:44,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  as."
2311,1:31:45,1:31:45,SPEAKER 8," Uh,  I should tell us all the shareholders. And we'll consistently do."
2312,1:31:50,1:31:51,SPEAKER 5, What is leading to.
2313,1:31:51,1:31:51,SPEAKER 1," Uh, the.  Uh, I think.  Uh, I.  Uh.  Uh, the.  Uh, you know, uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh, the.  Uh.  Uh, the.  Uh the.  Uh.  It's funny.  Pretty.  When I eve, it's funny.  I.  If the.  His.  Were, if.  The.  Uh.  Who's here again?  Oh.   I'm with his determineoodected organization,  and while you're here to.  The case, you are Til Baldwin in."
2314,1:31:52,1:31:53,SPEAKER 5," Um, we'll consistently say what is we think is right? "
2315,1:31:55,1:31:55,SPEAKER 6, Charlie?
2316,1:31:57,1:31:57,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
2317,1:31:58,1:32:04,SPEAKER 4, We want owners who understand what they own.
2318,1:32:05,1:32:20,SPEAKER 3," Now, that does mean they have to  understand how business is really operated and should be operated by owning managers.  Would have made that accounting change.  The counts did it just because they had a.  Wild moment."
2319,1:32:50,1:32:51,SPEAKER 1," Uh,  and I don't know what the accountants were thinking when they read that change.  It strikes me as bonkers.  Yeah.  Absolutely bonkers.  I don't see how anybody who understands how businesses really operated and should be operated by owning managers.  Would have made that accounting change. "
2320,1:32:51,1:32:51,SPEAKER 9," The question is, what is the question? "
2321,1:32:51,1:32:51,SPEAKER 1," Twenty twenty  five years ago, I suggested the audit profession.  That they just."
2322,1:32:57,1:32:58,SPEAKER 6, That the.
2323,1:32:58,1:33:01,BUFFETT, Audit committee asked.  Orders for questions.
2324,1:33:02,1:33:04,SPEAKER 1, And.  Uh.
2325,1:33:05,1:33:08,SPEAKER 5, The shareholders would know a lot more about the company.
2326,1:33:08,1:33:20,SPEAKER 3, If those questions were asked.  But it wasn't good for  the auditors to be asked those questions because it might increase their liability if they.  If they answered them in a client didn't want them to answer them because the man even didn't want them to.
2327,1:33:20,1:33:21,SPEAKER 4," No, they were. "
2328,1:33:21,1:33:21,SPEAKER 1, Uh.
2329,1:33:21,1:33:49,SPEAKER 4," They want a system where if they follow certain rules, they're safe.  And that's understandable.  But I don't think the.  Past Europe, this rule requiring.  Changes in.  Markable securities to go through the annual account quarterly.  They didn't do that to protect themselves from liability.  They just did that for some crazy reason.  Of their own. "
2330,1:33:49,1:33:50,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.
2331,1:33:50,1:33:51,SPEAKER 9, Get a.
2332,1:33:51,1:34:07,SPEAKER 4, A bunch of people who are all being.  Drawing a lot of pay out of a big complicated system and.  Rising in it like so many officers in the army.  God knows what they'll do if you put them in a little room by themselves and.  Tell them to invent new accounting standards.
2333,1:34:10,1:34:12,SPEAKER 3," Well, to our order to remember that's Charlie talking. "
2334,1:34:12,1:34:16,BUFFETT, That's right.  But I agree with him.
2335,1:34:17,1:34:17,SPEAKER 1, I don't.
2336,1:34:17,1:34:20,BUFFETT, He's he's ninety ninety nine.
2337,1:34:20,1:34:21,SPEAKER 5," You know, what's the. "
2338,1:34:21,1:34:28,BUFFETT, Way more than I can get away with.  Okay.  Station to.
2339,1:34:28,1:34:36,SPEAKER 4," But what he said is enormously important.  I mean, it just.  You gotta have some insights into what the hell really goes on.  And even if you're counting the."
2340,1:34:39,1:34:40,SPEAKER 5, Yeah.
2341,1:34:41,1:34:42,BUFFETT, Okay.  Station to.
2342,1:34:42,1:34:43,SPEAKER 9, Dear.
2343,1:34:43,1:35:17,SPEAKER 1, All dear Charlie.  My name is Victoria.  I'm 22 years old and I study Munich at the city.  The center of digital technology and management.  As your grandchildren are more in my age.  Let me ask you.  How do you transfer your wisdom to your grandchildren and.  How do you lead them to investing.  Do you see value in investing?  As a family or individually.  Thank you.
2344,1:35:17,1:35:20,SPEAKER 3, I'm going to Charlie do the answering.
2345,1:35:20,1:35:22,SPEAKER 4," He's got more.  Well, I have my grandchildren,  but.  I  am quite philosophical about my grandchildren.  Not thinking exactly the way I do.  It seems to me that's almost the natural course of life.  And.  I just live my.  Life my own way and.  They can observe a business.  If they want to.  If they don't, they can try some other way.  I don't like it when they try some other way. "
2346,1:35:53,1:35:54,SPEAKER 1, I.
2347,1:35:55,1:36:10,SPEAKER 4, I have to pretend that I like some of the boyfriends and girlfriends.  I don't like.  But I just struggle through like everybody else.  And usually I just bite my tongue and.  Keep silent.  That's my way of handling.
2348,1:36:13,1:36:15,BUFFETT," Well, I would say that I think that. "
2349,1:36:15,1:36:18,SPEAKER 4," My case, my three children have grown a lot smarter.  And the last 30 years and I think I've grown smarter and. And I know, but you needed a lot of help."
2350,1:36:25,1:36:26,BUFFETT, That is for sure.
2351,1:36:26,1:36:27,SPEAKER 3," No,  I would totally acknowledge that.  That's why I had the room to go. "
2352,1:36:32,1:36:34,BUFFETT," I mean, I had plenty of room for a group. "
2353,1:36:34,1:36:34,SPEAKER 6, But but.
2354,1:36:35,1:36:36,SPEAKER 4, But I all had a lot to grow.
2355,1:36:37,1:36:37,SPEAKER 1, I worked.
2356,1:36:37,1:36:42,SPEAKER 4," I worked a year for US Steel,  which was in there. "
2357,1:36:42,1:36:43,SPEAKER 6, Uh.
2358,1:36:44,1:37:00,SPEAKER 4," Fabrication Department in Los Angeles, a big operation.  The thing was utterly doomed.  Three years later, it went back to Greenfield.  So the whole thing was raised to the ground.  I did not see it coming.  Now, I would be that ignorant and that. "
2359,1:37:01,1:37:02,SPEAKER 1, As
2360,1:37:04,1:37:20,SPEAKER 4, I was at that age.  It was a sin and my professors by and large were even more ignorant than I was.  We just know what he was.  Nobody had observed.  The basic economics of business in a scientific way at all when I was young.
2361,1:37:21,1:37:22,SPEAKER 3," Well, we're getting into confession,  Tom."
2362,1:37:22,1:37:27,BUFFETT, I have to tell you it's 3 30.  So we don't want to keep going on.
2363,1:37:27,1:37:29,SPEAKER 3, Who knows what we'll be saying in another half hour.
2364,1:37:30,1:37:36,BUFFETT, So.  So I thank you all very much for coming at 4 30.
2365,1:37:36,1:37:41,SPEAKER 3, We will have the shareholders meeting here and the.
2366,1:37:42,1:37:43,BUFFETT, The we're continuing to.
2367,1:37:43,1:37:50,SPEAKER 1," Sell those for another 20 or 25 minutes.  We've already broken all kinds of records,  but let's really make it tougher comparison the next year.  And I think again, I think you were coming come next year and maybe we'll figure out the answer to the football or these questions. And that concludes the afternoon session of this year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting.  More on Buffett and Charlie Munger finishing a second 2.5 hour session talking to shareholders answering their questions.  Welcome back to our special coverage of the Berkshire annual meeting.  I'm Mike Santoli Becky will be back in the next year.  Becky will be back with us shortly when Warren and Charlie came back from lunch.  The signs at the front of their table showed the audience.  They were ready to talk about the banking crisis.  Buffett signs said available for sale.  Charlie signs said held to maturity.  Buffett seemed to lay the blame for the problems at the feet of everyone from the bankers to the government and the regulators.  Listen to what he said."
2368,1:38:49,1:38:51,BUFFETT, The message is.
2369,1:38:51,1:38:53,SPEAKER 8, It's been very poor.
2370,1:38:54,1:38:54,SPEAKER 1, It's  been poor by the.  The politicians who sometimes have an interest in having it poor.
2371,1:39:00,1:39:03,SPEAKER 8, It's been poor by the agencies.  And I'd say it's been poor by the press.
2372,1:39:06,1:39:10,SPEAKER 3," I mean, you shouldn't have so many people that misunderstand the fact. "
2373,1:39:11,1:39:13,SPEAKER 8, That although there may be a debt ceiling.
2374,1:39:14,1:39:16,SPEAKER 3, It's going to get changed.
2375,1:39:17,1:39:18,SPEAKER 8, Although there's a $250
2376,1:39:18,1:39:20,BUFFETT,",000 limit on FDIC. "
2377,1:39:20,1:39:20,SPEAKER 5, The FDIC.
2378,1:39:21,1:39:28,BUFFETT, The U.S.  government and American public have no interest in having a  bank fail and have deposits.  Actually lost by people.
2379,1:39:38,1:39:42,SPEAKER 1, Warren also took his shots at First Republic.  It's management team and how they ran their business.
2380,1:39:44,1:39:50,SPEAKER 3," You'll have to have a punishment for the people that do the wrong thing.  And if you take First Republic, for example, you could look at their 10 K and you could see that they were offering.  Non-government guaranteed mortgages to.  And jumble amounts at fixed rates. "
2381,1:40:12,1:40:15,BUFFETT, Sometimes for 10 years before they changed the floating.  And that's a crazy proposition.
2382,1:40:19,1:40:20,SPEAKER 8, If it's to the advantage of the bank.
2383,1:40:20,1:40:25,BUFFETT," They get it.  They get the guy coming in and says,  I'll read for financial one and a half percent and then one percent. And if it's that's the advantage the other way."
2384,1:40:32,1:40:32,SPEAKER 1, The  fellow keeps it out of 10 years.
2385,1:40:34,1:40:36,SPEAKER 5, You don't give options like that.
2386,1:40:36,1:40:36,SPEAKER 1, But.
2387,1:40:37,1:40:37,SPEAKER 6, But  that's what First Republic was doing.
2388,1:40:40,1:40:41,BUFFETT, It was plain sight.  And the world ignored it till it blew up.
2389,0:00:00,0:00:01,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, it is. "
2390,0:00:01,0:00:01,SPEAKER 4, Yeah.
2391,0:00:03,0:00:03,SPEAKER 2," Okay, Becky. "
2392,0:00:04,0:00:24,SPEAKER 1," This question comes from David Cass,  who is a professor at the Business School at University of Maryland.  He says, at last year's annual meeting,  Warren mentioned that Berkshire had taken a large  stake in Activision Blizzard as a merger arbitrage play.  Since the UK regulator has blocked its acquisition by Microsoft,  his Berkshire reduced or sold  its stake. "
2393,0:00:24,0:00:36,BUFFETT," Well, I think in terms of what we do with stocks,  we don't give information except when required,  which is in the 13th after what are we filed.  And there's some, there's certain things you can actually figure out by looking at our 10 or 10 Q, which we followed this morning, but you have to look pretty hard."
2394,0:00:49,0:00:51,SPEAKER 8, But I would say this.
2395,0:00:54,0:00:57,BUFFETT, I think Microsoft has been remarkably.
2396,0:00:58,0:01:39,SPEAKER 8," What's the word?  Willing to cooperate with governing bodies and I mean,  they want to do the deal and they met the opposition.  It seems to me more than halfway, but.  That doesn't mean that it gets done if.  I've given country in this case, the UK.  Wants to block it.  They're in a better position to block it than the United States,  but just the way the world works."
2397,0:01:44,0:01:47,SPEAKER 8, That doesn't get solved by offering more money.
2398,0:01:49,0:01:51,SPEAKER 4, I don't know how it.
2399,0:01:52,0:01:53,BUFFETT, How it turns out.
2400,0:01:54,0:01:58,SPEAKER 4," But if it doesn't go through,  I don't think it's through any."
2401,0:02:00,0:02:04,SPEAKER 9, Any short coming by either Microsoft or Activision.
2402,0:02:07,0:02:10,SPEAKER 7, Not everything that should happen does happen.
2403,0:02:11,0:02:14,SPEAKER 4," Well, we weren't we ran into it when we. "
2404,0:02:15,0:02:16,SPEAKER 7, When we bought.
2405,0:02:17,0:02:17,SPEAKER 1, What  made the deal with Dominion energy.  18 months ago and that they let us buy.  A good bit of what we wanted to buy and then. And then.
2406,0:02:29,0:02:33,SPEAKER 7," It was government in effect said.  You can't buy something else,  which I think we would have done a better job with them.  Anybody else did in which.  The states involved in our object to it,  which the customers didn't object to it. "
2407,0:02:44,0:02:47,SPEAKER 7, You don't take on the United States government.
2408,0:02:47,0:02:47,SPEAKER 1," You know, and. "
2409,0:02:49,0:02:50,SPEAKER 9, You try and figure out things that.
2410,0:02:51,0:02:53,SPEAKER 7, That you won't have a problem with.
2411,0:02:54,0:03:04,SPEAKER 7," I think in that case,  the US government made a mistake.  I think the British government's making a mistake in this case, but.  But that's that's life in the big city,  sure I would say."
2412,0:03:06,0:03:12,SPEAKER 1, What we do will depend  on a lot of things.  Charlie.
2413,0:03:14,0:03:16,SPEAKER 3," Well, I think.  But we do. "
2414,0:03:20,0:03:23,SPEAKER 3, You kiss that one off beautifully.
2415,0:03:27,0:03:30,BUFFETT," Okay, station 10. "
2416,0:03:32,0:03:57,SPEAKER 1," Hi, Warren.  Hi, Charlie.  My name is Anderson Fuller and I'm from Avamport Nova Scotia in Canada.  And before I ask my question,  I just want to thank you for all you've done to give us insight into your minds as investors.  So for me, the most compelling takeaway from Berkshire is your guys's emphasis on and successful use of properly aligned incentives.  In my view, owning and leading a business has two central benefits. "
2417,0:03:58,0:03:58,SPEAKER 2," First,  you directly benefit as the company goes through your equity in it.  And second,  you have autonomy.  Incentives for employees are a bit easier to understand,  such as offering benefits,  fair pay and creating a strong culture.  But I've always struggled to understand them at the highest level.  Even though you say Berkshire gives its managers significant flexibility,  it must be less than what they have when they were independent.  Additionally,  you would think passion and a willingness to sell would be inversely correlated.  So how exactly does Berkshire bridges gap and incentivize owners of its subsidiaries to give up these benefits to Berkshire?  Thank you."
2418,0:04:34,0:04:40,SPEAKER 7," Well, we really hope to find is managers who love their business. "
2419,0:04:42,0:04:47,SPEAKER 8, But don't.  Like a lot of what comes with it as a public company.
2420,0:04:47,0:04:48,SPEAKER 1," I mean, if they have to spend. "
2421,0:04:48,0:04:50,SPEAKER 9, A lot of time listening to people.
2422,0:04:52,0:04:54,BUFFETT, Tell them what to do about this or that.  And they can't afford to irritate them.
2423,0:04:57,0:05:01,SPEAKER 4, Or they have to go along with their trade  association because whatever they may call it.
2424,0:05:07,0:05:09,SPEAKER 9, Because you don't want to look like a free rider.  And there's all kinds of things.
2425,0:05:11,0:05:15,SPEAKER 8, Compromises that people have to make in most jobs.  And Charlie and I.
2426,0:05:18,0:05:21,SPEAKER 7, Solve that problem.
2427,0:05:21,0:05:23,BUFFETT, I had five bosses in my life.  And I liked all five of them. And two of them were just huge factors in making my life better.
2428,0:05:32,0:05:34,SPEAKER 1, But I liked all five of them.  A couple of them are.
2429,0:05:34,0:05:34,SPEAKER 4," You know,  some people there."
2430,0:05:37,0:05:38,SPEAKER 1," GAC penny,  Cooper Smith,  you know, worth the seventy five since an hour.  I love. "
2431,0:05:42,0:05:46,SPEAKER 7," I love working at pennies.  Well, I didn't love working at pennies. "
2432,0:05:46,0:05:47,SPEAKER 4, But I love working.
2433,0:05:49,0:05:50,SPEAKER 1, Cooper Smith and.
2434,0:05:51,0:05:54,SPEAKER 7," And, you know, with seventy five cents an hour. "
2435,0:05:54,0:05:58,SPEAKER 1," But I had to do  what they told me to do,  which was to sell men's shirts first and men's clothing and children's clothing and so on."
2436,0:06:04,0:06:06,SPEAKER 7, I love working for the newspaper.  And I had a great manager when I was a nurse in Nebraska.
2437,0:06:11,0:06:12,BUFFETT, Got to work for Ben Graham.
2438,0:06:12,0:06:14,SPEAKER 1," I mean, everything worked out. "
2439,0:06:16,0:06:22,SPEAKER 7, There's nothing like working for yourself.  And if you can't own a big company.
2440,0:06:24,0:06:25,SPEAKER 1, Working at Berkshire Hathaway.
2441,0:06:26,0:06:33,SPEAKER 7, We're running a company.  Is the closest thing you will get.
2442,0:06:33,0:06:36,SPEAKER 1, You don't have to spend time.  You're not putting analysts.
2443,0:06:36,0:06:39,SPEAKER 7, You probably have contempt for.
2444,0:06:40,0:06:41,SPEAKER 1," In many cases,  you don't have to spend time with banks.  You know,  getting money and particularly in terrible times."
2445,0:06:48,0:06:49,SPEAKER 9, There's all kinds of.
2446,0:06:49,0:06:50,SPEAKER 8, You get a lot.  And the way of freedom.
2447,0:06:53,0:06:55,SPEAKER 7, I would think would be meaningful.
2448,0:06:56,0:06:57,SPEAKER 8, To me.  And it might be better if you own the whole place yourself.
2449,0:07:00,0:07:01,SPEAKER 1, But maybe you've got siblings.
2450,0:07:02,0:07:09,SPEAKER 1, Maybe there's a million reasons why.  You may not be able to achieve.  That.  Unless you sell.
2451,0:07:11,0:07:12,SPEAKER 8, To Berkshire.
2452,0:07:13,0:07:20,SPEAKER 7, That's easier probably if you have a family business where people want to go in different directions than it is with a public company.
2453,0:07:21,0:07:24,SPEAKER 4, But.  There's still possibilities there.
2454,0:07:24,0:07:24,SPEAKER 1, So that's.
2455,0:07:25,0:07:25,SPEAKER 8, That's why.
2456,0:07:27,0:07:33,SPEAKER 7, That's why I.  I think if I owned a public company.  And it was worth many.
2457,0:07:33,0:07:33,SPEAKER 4, Right.
2458,0:07:33,0:07:34,SPEAKER 8, Many billions of dollars.  And Berkshire Hathaway.  Wanted to buy it. And shareholders were willing to vote it.
2459,0:07:46,0:07:50,BUFFETT, Considered the way I would feel about life.  But one thing I wouldn't want to retire at 65.
2460,0:07:51,0:07:52,SPEAKER 7, I want to keep working.
2461,0:07:54,0:07:57,SPEAKER 1, We.  We just.
2462,0:07:58,0:08:01,SPEAKER 8, There's there are reasons to sell to Berkshire.
2463,0:08:01,0:08:02,BUFFETT, Which Charlie and I.
2464,0:08:02,0:08:04,SPEAKER 8, In certain positions.
2465,0:08:04,0:08:06,BUFFETT, If we were on the other side would take the deal.
2466,0:08:07,0:08:10,SPEAKER 4, But it isn't for everybody.
2467,0:08:14,0:08:20,SPEAKER 3, I think we have a pretty good one.  We've been very lucky in.
2468,0:08:21,0:08:22,SPEAKER 1, I  don't know.  It seems to be that most of the people who are going to end up the way we did.  They almost already know how to do it.
2469,0:08:36,0:08:38,SPEAKER 9, Well the most important purchase.  And retrospect that we may have made.
2470,0:08:41,0:08:45,SPEAKER 1, Was national and definitely not because specifically what it will want to do.  And Jack Ringwald controlled the company.
2471,0:08:50,0:08:51,BUFFETT, I know him and liked him.
2472,0:08:53,0:08:54,BUFFETT, He knew me.  And once a year.
2473,0:08:57,0:08:57,SPEAKER 8, He'd get irritated.
2474,0:09:01,0:09:03,SPEAKER 9, Nebraska Department insurance or so many would.
2475,0:09:03,0:09:06,SPEAKER 1," Come, come around.  And it said they all. "
2476,0:09:06,0:09:06,SPEAKER 9, Always came around.
2477,0:09:07,0:09:09,BUFFETT, When the carbon racetrack was open.
2478,0:09:09,0:09:09,SPEAKER 1, You know so they.
2479,0:09:09,0:09:12,SPEAKER 4, I mean he had all these theories about why.
2480,0:09:13,0:09:14,SPEAKER 1, Was a pain in the neck.
2481,0:09:15,0:09:16,SPEAKER 4, To be regulated.  And I. And I.
2482,0:09:19,0:09:19,BUFFETT, Told Charlie Hider.
2483,0:09:20,0:09:21,SPEAKER 7, Next time.
2484,0:09:22,0:09:23,BUFFETT, Jack is in that mood.
2485,0:09:24,0:09:26,SPEAKER 8, Where he's ready to sell this because he's tired of.
2486,0:09:26,0:09:27,SPEAKER 1, Well I'm with all these guys.   He sure find him.  And so.  Charlie called me one day and he says.  Jack is in the heat.  And I said.  Bring him.  Come over.  And we made a deal.
2487,0:09:38,0:09:40,BUFFETT, Well that's why Jack sold.  And he was happy after he made the deal.  And I was happy after we made the deal.
2488,0:09:44,0:09:45,SPEAKER 9, So there's a man that controlled the business.
2489,0:09:46,0:09:47,SPEAKER 4, But just decided.
2490,0:09:48,0:09:52,BUFFETT, These people didn't seem to bother him as much once they were my problem and not his.
2491,0:09:53,0:09:54,SPEAKER 1, You just can't tell.
2492,0:09:55,0:09:56,SPEAKER 7, One lightening strike.
2493,0:09:58,0:10:01,BUFFETT, That didn't do magnificent things for us initially.
2494,0:10:01,0:10:03,SPEAKER 8, But just look at what it led to.
2495,0:10:03,0:10:03,SPEAKER 5, You know.  And then.
2496,0:10:04,0:10:20,SPEAKER 1, So you never.  You know.  If you know.  If you know how you were going to get.  If you know how you're going to show all 18 holes.  It wasn't really fun playing.  You wouldn't get on the first tee.  I mean it's.  It's.  It's the.  It's the uncertainty.
2497,0:10:20,0:10:21,SPEAKER 7, The fun of playing the game.
2498,0:10:22,0:10:23,SPEAKER 9, The opponent's all kinds of things that.
2499,0:10:24,0:10:25,SPEAKER 1, Make a game interesting.
2500,0:10:26,0:10:27,SPEAKER 9, I think Charlie are.
2501,0:10:28,0:10:30,SPEAKER 7, I are in the most interesting game in the world.
2502,0:10:33,0:10:58,SPEAKER 1, Okay Becky.  Here's a question.  From Simon Withers in Perth in Western Australia.  It's been a long time since we've heard about C's candy and net jets.  Could you please give us an update on C's performance and when you project it will run out of places to open stores in the United States.  And could you also give us an overview of how net jets has performed since its acquisition.  And whether it's achieved the potential you saw at the time of that acquisition.
2503,0:10:59,0:11:07,SPEAKER 7, With C's it hasn't been a question of opening stores we find out that we we've tried about with at this wonderful.
2504,0:11:09,0:11:10,SPEAKER 9, Miranda doesn't travel.
2505,0:11:11,0:11:11,SPEAKER 5, You know.
2506,0:11:13,0:11:16,SPEAKER 1, The mistake.
2507,0:11:17,0:11:18,SPEAKER 8, The actual product.
2508,0:11:19,0:11:27,SPEAKER 1, The feelings people have about some things as we said before.  I mean it sometimes is.  It's limited to give them.  And want to help us.
2509,0:11:28,0:11:28,SPEAKER 2," What you know.  And Martha sounds bad, and you ask them."
2510,0:11:28,0:11:32,SPEAKER 4, Margaret is Doctor Pris all.  The huge rateы in Dallas Falls where.
2511,0:11:32,0:11:39,BUFFETT, Maybe I maybe ten times the percentage per capita maybe that it has in Detroit or Boston.  And you say well how can that be with the product been around for century and people travel and you have national advertising and I'm not sure but I keep learning more as I watch different brands and Charlie and I are  economics were so good in California that we tried to in many cases the same experiment over and over again doesn't cost much the experiment.
2512,0:12:03,0:12:16,SPEAKER 7, We tried everything in the world to the band brand to travel and we always think we were right for the first week and then we find out that that the  magic.
2513,0:12:17,0:12:26,BUFFETT, We can we can beat any other candy store pretty much but there aren't any candy stores in the world because the world was changed so.   I  see is a 101 years now it has magic and it has limited magic. And sort of the adjacent West you can almost as gravitational almost and and then you get to the east and incidentally in the east people prefer dark chocolate to.
2514,0:12:50,0:12:57,SPEAKER 7, The to milk chocolate in the West people for milk chocolate to dark the east things so miniatures and dark.
2515,0:12:57,0:13:06,BUFFETT, I mean there's all kinds of crazy things in the world that consumers do but you want to keep observing it because you do learn a little.  And with Charlie and I'm.
2516,0:13:06,0:13:09,SPEAKER 7, The the  temptation to keep trying things because the economics were so good if we succeeded.  So we tried various things and of course every man.  And I think you want to try to come along because they have one you know that it should work but it doesn't work.  So that's that's what makes it very interesting and yet just we we have really learned how to distinguish.
2517,0:13:41,0:13:42,BUFFETT, Justifiably distinguish.
2518,0:13:43,0:13:45,SPEAKER 8, A service.
2519,0:13:47,0:13:52,SPEAKER 7, The people so that if you can.  You have to be very well to do.
2520,0:13:53,0:13:54,SPEAKER 8, To use it.
2521,0:13:55,0:13:57,SPEAKER 7, But if you're very well to do your in effect.
2522,0:13:58,0:13:59,BUFFETT, Your spending your errors.
2523,0:13:59,0:14:00,SPEAKER 1, Money.
2524,0:14:01,0:14:10,SPEAKER 7, I mean it's what I told my analysts after she went from teaching to be worth.  Millions and millions of dollars and she came to see me.  She never been married.
2525,0:14:10,0:14:17,SPEAKER 7, He said can I afford to buy this for a code in nineteen sixty or nine and I said Alice you weren't buying it.
2526,0:14:17,0:14:20,BUFFETT, Your nieces and nephews are buying it because that's who you're leaving here.
2527,0:14:20,0:14:20,SPEAKER 2, I mean it's not.  I'm big.  I'm not.  I've.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.
2528,0:15:21,0:15:24,BUFFETT, Flight over to Tokyo and we arrived in.
2529,0:15:25,0:15:30,SPEAKER 7, Good shape and we spent a couple days there and we flew back and there's just nothing to it now.
2530,0:15:30,0:15:32,SPEAKER 1, You can say well.
2531,0:15:32,0:15:36,SPEAKER 7, You're getting sort of decked at all out in your old age but.
2532,0:15:36,0:15:39,SPEAKER 1, Flight  money will go to.
2533,0:15:40,0:15:41,BUFFETT, The lines are being low.
2534,0:15:42,0:15:46,SPEAKER 7, Money will probably be 100 billion or more and I forget the flights.
2535,0:15:46,0:15:48,SPEAKER 9, Please want me to spend a few bucks on myself.
2536,0:15:49,0:15:53,BUFFETT, It all has to do with the last dollars that are spent by.
2537,0:15:54,0:15:57,SPEAKER 9, Various points of peace which have plenty of problems finding things to do to make.
2538,0:15:58,0:15:58,SPEAKER 1, Lots of sense.
2539,0:15:58,0:15:58,SPEAKER 2, So.
2540,0:15:59,0:16:01,SPEAKER 8, That just.
2541,0:16:01,0:16:02,SPEAKER 4, There isn't any competitor.
2542,0:16:03,0:16:03,SPEAKER 7, I mean we looked at.
2543,0:16:04,0:16:05,SPEAKER 1, The other day.
2544,0:16:07,0:16:07,SPEAKER 8, Weals up.
2545,0:16:08,0:16:13,SPEAKER 1, Stock came out of ten dollars.  A couple years ago.
2546,0:16:14,0:16:22,BUFFETT, Selling at forty eight cents the other day and they got twelve thousand six hundred people.  They've given a bill a billion dollars.
2547,0:16:22,0:16:33,SPEAKER 7, A little over a billion dollars on prepaid prepaid cards where they.  Give them the money and they get a certain number of hours later on and.
2548,0:16:33,0:16:35,SPEAKER 1, They don't.
2549,0:16:36,0:16:43,SPEAKER 7, I think there's a good chance that some people are going to be very disappointed later on when they have money to.
2550,0:16:43,0:16:47,SPEAKER 1, To that jet say.  They know well get.
2551,0:16:48,0:16:58,SPEAKER 7, They'll get on the same planes with the same pilots.  As I am my family.  I've flown on since before we bought the company.
2552,0:16:58,0:17:03,SPEAKER 9, So it's not it's not shaped by.  Wasn't the decision was shaped by some commercial.
2553,0:17:05,0:17:05,SPEAKER 5, Uh.
2554,0:17:05,0:17:06,SPEAKER 1, Object of.
2555,0:17:07,0:17:10,SPEAKER 8, Couple years before.  I never heard of that.
2556,0:17:10,0:17:10,SPEAKER 1, Yes.
2557,0:17:10,0:17:18,SPEAKER 7, Frank Rooney mentioned it to me and.  I've watched share share immediately and we bought the company and.
2558,0:17:21,0:17:22,SPEAKER 1, Every.  Well.
2559,0:17:23,0:17:32,BUFFETT, My kids have to fight commercial sometimes but they sometimes they get to use hours too but.  I've never flown anything else and why would I.
2560,0:17:32,0:17:35,SPEAKER 1, I mean it's.  It's.  It's the gold.  And.
2561,0:17:37,0:17:39,SPEAKER 4, Nobody will.
2562,0:17:40,0:17:42,SPEAKER 1, Match our fleet.  I mean if you got.
2563,0:17:43,0:17:49,SPEAKER 7, Six hundred planes you've got them a lot more places in the United States than  anybody else will have theirs.
2564,0:17:50,0:17:56,BUFFETT, I think with the second largest.  Coming to commercial our owners and our fleet's growing like I say.
2565,0:17:58,0:18:05,SPEAKER 7, The year so.  It's a marvelous company and.  Adam Johnson has performed.
2566,0:18:10,0:18:12,SPEAKER 7, You just can't believe what he's done.
2567,0:18:14,0:18:21,SPEAKER 7, With the business and it was a tough model for a long time.  But he's brought a word is and we've got.
2568,0:18:21,0:18:22,SPEAKER 8, We should.
2569,0:18:23,0:18:25,SPEAKER 7, Have a wonderful company for.
2570,0:18:25,0:18:28,SPEAKER 1, Forever.  Charlie.
2571,0:18:31,0:18:36,SPEAKER 3, Well not just it's been remarkable.  You can argue that it's worth as much as any airline.
2572,0:18:37,0:18:37,SPEAKER 2, No.
2573,0:18:39,0:18:39,BUFFETT, It's so different.  And Charlie we had a hard time selling Charlie and that just membership.  And then we figured the way to get him.
2574,0:18:48,0:18:50,SPEAKER 8, To buy a membership was to put a coach seat.
2575,0:18:50,0:18:51,SPEAKER 1, In the.
2576,0:18:51,0:18:52,SPEAKER 9, The fuselage.
2577,0:18:53,0:18:56,SPEAKER 8, Not really knocked him off.
2578,0:18:56,0:18:56,SPEAKER 2, I mean.
2579,0:18:56,0:19:00,SPEAKER 8, I think he's the only one we saw on the basis of.
2580,0:19:00,0:19:13,SPEAKER 3, I used to come to the virtue of annual meetings on coach from Los Angeles and it was full of rich.  Stockholders and they would clap when I came into the coach section.  I really like that.
2581,0:19:14,0:19:26,SPEAKER 8, But I gotta tell you we some I corrupted about.
2582,0:19:31,0:19:33,SPEAKER 8, He feels he kind of has to explain it.   But he so flies at that.  And it'd be crazy not to.
2583,0:19:38,0:19:38,SPEAKER 4, You know.
2584,0:19:39,0:19:40,SPEAKER 8, It be a rare.
2585,0:19:41,0:19:42,BUFFETT, Are paying for it.
2586,0:19:42,0:19:43,SPEAKER 9, I mean if I be anybody.
2587,0:19:44,0:19:45,SPEAKER 1, Who's the state.
2588,0:19:46,0:19:49,BUFFETT, Came in and less than zero because what they spent in.
2589,0:19:50,0:19:50,SPEAKER 4, On that.  That's.
2590,0:19:51,0:19:52,SPEAKER 8, Through a minute of that position.
2591,0:19:53,0:19:54,SPEAKER 1, Let me know.
2592,0:19:55,0:19:55,SPEAKER 4, But I've.
2593,0:19:56,0:19:57,BUFFETT, I've never seen a case yet.
2594,0:19:57,0:19:59,SPEAKER 7, It won't be the case for the mother of a young and  it's the residual.
2595,0:20:02,0:20:04,BUFFETT, Bottom beneficiary that's paying.
2596,0:20:05,0:20:06,SPEAKER 4, For your.
2597,0:20:07,0:20:08,SPEAKER 7, Your membership and.
2598,0:20:09,0:20:14,BUFFETT, It's a little hard to get used to paying that much money though.  When you live like Charlie.
2599,0:20:15,0:20:17,SPEAKER 4, I have most of my.  Okay.
2600,0:20:18,0:20:19,SPEAKER 1, We will go to.
2601,0:20:20,0:20:22,SPEAKER 8, Section 11.
2602,0:20:26,0:20:26,SPEAKER 1, Hello.
2603,0:20:27,0:21:08,SPEAKER 2, My name is Humphrey Liu.  I'm from Charlottesville Virginia.  First I wanted to ask to wanted to add my thanks to you and.  Mr.  Munger and Mr.  Buffett and all Berkshire for throwing this grand event each year.  Looking at the global trend.  It increasingly does seem that zero mission vehicles may have finally reached the cusp of mass adoption.  Do you see any opportunities in this space either in specific vehicle manufacturers or in related technologies.
2604,0:21:10,0:21:11,SPEAKER 8, Well I would say that.
2605,0:21:12,0:21:13,SPEAKER 7, Charlie and.
2606,0:21:14,0:21:16,BUFFETT, Longer felt that the.
2607,0:21:17,0:21:19,SPEAKER 9, Auto industry is just too tough.
2608,0:21:19,0:21:21,SPEAKER 1, You know.  The Ford Motor Company.
2609,0:21:22,0:21:22,BUFFETT, I mean Henry Ford.
2610,0:21:24,0:21:26,SPEAKER 4, Looked like he owned the world.
2611,0:21:27,0:21:30,SPEAKER 1, With the model.  He and then.
2612,0:21:31,0:21:31,SPEAKER 5, And.
2613,0:21:32,0:21:35,BUFFETT, He brought down the price dramatically.  He took up wages dramatically.
2614,0:21:36,0:21:36,SPEAKER 1, He was.
2615,0:21:37,0:21:40,SPEAKER 7, He might have been with a different personality.
2616,0:21:44,0:21:45,SPEAKER 1, Some different views.
2617,0:21:46,0:21:48,BUFFETT, I'd been like to present the United States.
2618,0:21:48,0:21:57,SPEAKER 7, I mean there's there's a good book that came up.  I don't know that recently that.  Total about the story of.  Tells a little about Nebraska in terms of it.  But Henry Ford and.
2619,0:21:58,0:21:58,SPEAKER 1, And.
2620,0:22:00,0:22:01,SPEAKER 7, Thomas Edison joining up.
2621,0:22:02,0:22:05,SPEAKER 1, But.  Maybe a year or two.  It's.
2622,0:22:05,0:22:05,SPEAKER 2, If you're interested.
2623,0:22:07,0:22:08,SPEAKER 9, You ought to read that book.
2624,0:22:09,0:22:10,SPEAKER 1, Henry Ford did that.
2625,0:22:10,0:22:10,SPEAKER 5, And.
2626,0:22:11,0:22:12,SPEAKER 4, You know.
2627,0:22:12,0:22:12,SPEAKER 2, And.  20 years later.  That.
2628,0:22:15,0:22:17,SPEAKER 7, They were losing money and.
2629,0:22:17,0:22:18,SPEAKER 8, They had a guy with.
2630,0:22:18,0:22:20,SPEAKER 1, Gun in his pocket.
2631,0:22:20,0:22:20,SPEAKER 7, I think Harry Bennett.
2632,0:22:21,0:22:21,SPEAKER 5, You know.
2633,0:22:22,0:22:24,BUFFETT, Was running the Ford Motor Company.
2634,0:22:24,0:22:26,SPEAKER 1, It was.  Honest way.
2635,0:22:26,0:22:27,SPEAKER 6, To the junk.
2636,0:22:27,0:22:29,SPEAKER 7, He won the whiskers came in.
2637,0:22:30,0:22:33,BUFFETT, Henry Ford the second Hank the deuce as I call him.
2638,0:22:33,0:22:34,SPEAKER 1, Brought in Texas or.  And then.
2639,0:22:35,0:22:36,BUFFETT, My friend or J.
2640,0:22:36,0:22:37,SPEAKER 7, McLearn a few people.
2641,0:22:38,0:22:41,SPEAKER 1, It's just.  It.  I.
2642,0:22:42,0:22:43,SPEAKER 8, I read.
2643,0:22:44,0:22:45,SPEAKER 1, It's reading the other day.
2644,0:22:45,0:22:48,BUFFETT, Actually the 1932 annual report of General Motors.
2645,0:22:49,0:22:50,SPEAKER 1, It's one of.
2646,0:22:50,0:22:51,SPEAKER 9, The best annual reports of.
2647,0:22:51,0:22:53,SPEAKER 1, I read it.  Totally honest.
2648,0:22:54,0:22:54,SPEAKER 4, You know.
2649,0:22:54,0:22:58,BUFFETT," Assessment of exactly where they were.  They had 19,000 dealers. "
2650,0:22:59,0:23:01,SPEAKER 9, Population as I mentioned earlier.
2651,0:23:01,0:23:03,SPEAKER 7, About 120 million or so.
2652,0:23:04,0:23:06,SPEAKER 9, Now with 330 million people.
2653,0:23:06,0:23:10,BUFFETT, All brands in the United States have like 18 thousand dealers or something.
2654,0:23:11,0:23:12,SPEAKER 8, It's just a business.
2655,0:23:12,0:23:16,SPEAKER 1, Where you've got a lot of worldwide competitors.  They're not going to go away.
2656,0:23:18,0:23:19,SPEAKER 8, They look like.
2657,0:23:20,0:23:22,BUFFETT, Looks like there are winners at any given time.
2658,0:23:23,0:23:23,SPEAKER 8, But it doesn't.
2659,0:23:24,0:23:25,SPEAKER 1, Get to a permanent place.
2660,0:23:26,0:23:32,SPEAKER 7, Although as I mentioned I would say Ferrari is in a special place.  But I only saw up in there.
2661,0:23:32,0:23:34,SPEAKER 1, Twelve thousand cars.  A year.
2662,0:23:36,0:23:37,SPEAKER 1, U.  S.  last year.
2663,0:23:38,0:23:39,SPEAKER 7, I think there were 14 million something.
2664,0:23:42,0:23:45,SPEAKER 1, It's not a business where.
2665,0:23:45,0:23:47,SPEAKER 8, We find it fascinating to be in.
2666,0:23:47,0:23:48,BUFFETT, We like our dealership operation.
2667,0:23:50,0:23:56,SPEAKER 7, But I don't think I can tell you what the auto industry will look at.  Look like five or ten years now.  I do think that you're right.
2668,0:24:00,0:24:06,SPEAKER 7, You will see a change in the vehicles but.  You won't see anybody that owns the market because they change the vehicle.
2669,0:24:07,0:24:07,SPEAKER 1, Charlie.
2670,0:24:08,0:24:17,SPEAKER 3, Well electric vehicles.  Coming big time.  And that's a very interesting development.  At the moment.
2671,0:24:19,0:24:27,SPEAKER 3, Imposing.  Huge capital costs and you.  And  I don't like you capital costs and you.  And  we're subsidizing in the United States and we're actually doing it right putting in a.
2672,0:24:33,0:24:34,SPEAKER 4, Pro labor time.
2673,0:24:36,0:24:38,BUFFETT, Somebody to politics like you can't believe to.
2674,0:24:40,0:24:42,SPEAKER 8, It's it's going to be with us.  We're not going to quit.
2675,0:24:42,0:24:46,BUFFETT, What I mean cars and American public has a lot of.
2676,0:24:46,0:24:46,SPEAKER 1, With them.
2677,0:24:49,0:24:51,SPEAKER 1, I.  Think I know.
2678,0:24:52,0:25:00,SPEAKER 7, Where Apple's going to be in five or ten years and I don't know what.  The car companies are in five or ten years.  And I may be wrong but that's.
2679,0:25:01,0:25:04,SPEAKER 1, We.  Charlie.
2680,0:25:05,0:25:06,SPEAKER 7, Follow the auto business.
2681,0:25:08,0:25:09,SPEAKER 5, Intense interest.
2682,0:25:09,0:25:10,SPEAKER 1, Charlie's firm.
2683,0:25:11,0:25:15,BUFFETT, Was the specialist in general motors on the Pacific Coast stock exchange and that was.
2684,0:25:15,0:25:16,SPEAKER 1, That was a franchise.
2685,0:25:17,0:25:17,SPEAKER 9, Wouldn't it try.
2686,0:25:17,0:25:21,SPEAKER 3, Yeah we get by working very high.  I mean it might be a minor or a minor.
2687,0:25:22,0:25:23,SPEAKER 1, What's the  minor at the time.  Was it.  Was it.
2688,0:25:30,0:25:32,SPEAKER 9, Well I was pretty minor.
2689,0:25:32,0:26:02,SPEAKER 1, OK.  Becky.  This question comes from Lindsey Peter Schumacher in Cedar Rapids Iowa.  Does the current size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet concern you in particular the result of quantitative easing.  The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet out of nothing.  The net effect in essence is a form of single entry accounting creating something of value out of nothing other than a series of book entries.  Entries and wondering what Mr.  Munger thinks about this as well.
2690,0:26:04,0:26:06,SPEAKER 9, Well I don't think the Federal Reserve is the problem and I think.
2691,0:26:07,0:26:08,BUFFETT, They can't solve.
2692,0:26:08,0:26:10,SPEAKER 8, The fiscal problem.
2693,0:26:13,0:26:17,SPEAKER 8, I don't I do not worry about the Federal Reserve and.
2694,0:26:18,0:26:19,SPEAKER 7, I think it's.
2695,0:26:20,0:26:21,SPEAKER 1, Fulfilling the functions.
2696,0:26:22,0:26:29,BUFFETT, For which it was established I probably would not have been.  They only they have two objectives and I would not have been.
2697,0:26:30,0:26:38,SPEAKER 7, One probably that would have changed the inflation objective to 2% a year from.  From 0 I think that.
2698,0:26:40,0:26:41,SPEAKER 1, You know I  think.  That.
2699,0:26:44,0:26:47,SPEAKER 7, If you tell you people that you're shooting to depreciate your currency.
2700,0:26:47,0:26:49,BUFFETT, At 2% a year.
2701,0:26:53,0:26:53,SPEAKER 2, A  lot of implications although it feels good to a lot of people want a little inflation.  But nobody wants a lot of inflation except somebody's got a lot of deaths and.
2702,0:27:09,0:27:12,SPEAKER 1, I I do not worry about.
2703,0:27:12,0:27:14,SPEAKER 7, The Federal Reserve balance sheet.
2704,0:27:14,0:27:17,SPEAKER 1, I enjoy looking at it and the numbers are big.
2705,0:27:17,0:27:18,SPEAKER 7, I was like big numbers but.
2706,0:27:20,0:27:23,SPEAKER 1, It is not.  It's interesting.
2707,0:27:24,0:27:28,BUFFETT, The most one one of the most interesting figures to me.  Is currency in circulation.
2708,0:27:29,0:27:30,SPEAKER 1," I mean it is gone.   They were saying cash is trash back in 2008.  7 and 8 and all that cash is going to disappear.  Well.  If you look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet it's gone from 800 billion to 2.2 trillion. And most of that's in $100 bills overwhelmingly. And if you're not I think there's about $5,100."
2709,0:27:50,0:27:51,BUFFETT, Or bills per person.
2710,0:27:52,0:27:54,SPEAKER 8, Babies everybody in the United States.
2711,0:27:55,0:27:58,SPEAKER 1, I would really like to know where.
2712,0:27:59,0:27:59,SPEAKER 4, All of that is.
2713,0:28:00,0:28:07,SPEAKER 1, I mean it.  Nobody's hoarding euro dollars.  You know in South America.  Africa or wherever.
2714,0:28:08,0:28:10,SPEAKER 1, The demand for currency.
2715,0:28:11,0:28:11,SPEAKER 2, You know.
2716,0:28:13,0:28:14,SPEAKER 1, Some of it may be used to be.
2717,0:28:15,0:28:17,SPEAKER 7, Several drug dealers.
2718,0:28:18,0:28:20,SPEAKER 9, Activities and all of that.
2719,0:28:20,0:28:22,SPEAKER 4, But anybody thinks cash is trash.
2720,0:28:24,0:28:25,SPEAKER 1, Auto look at the.
2721,0:28:26,0:28:28,SPEAKER 9, Look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet.  And actually you can look at how many $5 bills and $2 bills.
2722,0:28:32,0:28:32,SPEAKER 2, And.   Ones and all that.  And the action has been in $100 bills.  I mean it is.
2723,0:28:39,0:28:47,SPEAKER 7, It is just astounding.  The way that $100 bills have spread.  And of course we don't know where they are.  And I don't think the Fed can know exactly.
2724,0:28:50,0:28:54,BUFFETT, They probably make a lot better guess than I could.  But I do know what's happened.  And you can watch it every week.  And you'll watch currency in circulation.
2725,0:28:59,0:29:01,SPEAKER 8, Probably grow a little bit.
2726,0:29:01,0:29:01,SPEAKER 1, And.  And believe me.
2727,0:29:04,0:29:05,BUFFETT, Cash is not trash.
2728,0:29:09,0:29:44,SPEAKER 3, Well I don't know where we're headed with all of this.  It's been very extreme.  I think you could be pretty extreme and fighting.  Depressions and so forth.  If you were versioned afterwards to a period of.  Some discipline.  But if you're.  Some discipline.  But if you're going to just keep.  Borrowing printing money and spending it.  I think eventually it causes bad trouble.
2729,0:29:46,0:29:48,SPEAKER 3, You can see it in Latin America.  Latin America.
2730,0:29:50,0:30:07,SPEAKER 3, It's currency.  Get all the control all the time.  And of course it's like the United States and economic achievement greatly.  So I think we pay a price if we.  If we ever give up our old ways entirely.  And going to a new world where we just try and.  Print money.
2731,0:30:07,0:30:08,SPEAKER 3, Make it easier to get.
2732,0:30:09,0:30:10,SPEAKER 3, To get through the year.
2733,0:30:11,0:30:14,SPEAKER 1, We paid a price.
2734,0:30:14,0:30:16,SPEAKER 8, In World War two.
2735,0:30:17,0:30:17,SPEAKER 1, I mean everybody.
2736,0:30:18,0:30:19,SPEAKER 7, School kids and everybody.
2737,0:30:20,0:30:20,SPEAKER 1, That was myself included.
2738,0:30:22,0:30:28,BUFFETT, I mean we bought what we're originally called.  War bonds and defense bonds and savings bonds and all that.
2739,0:30:29,0:30:31,SPEAKER 1, From 1940.
2740,0:30:32,0:30:34,BUFFETT, To the 1944 or five.
2741,0:30:35,0:30:36,SPEAKER 8, You paid out of 1875.
2742,0:30:36,0:30:38,SPEAKER 9, I got twenty five dollars back and every kid.
2743,0:30:39,0:30:41,BUFFETT, Save savings and all that.
2744,0:30:41,0:30:42,SPEAKER 1, But when you got all through.
2745,0:30:43,0:30:44,SPEAKER 5, You know.
2746,0:30:45,0:30:45,SPEAKER 2, You had.  120% of GDP.  And.
2747,0:30:50,0:30:52,SPEAKER 7, The national debt instead of 30 or 40%.  And we had a lot of inflation.  Subsequently.
2748,0:30:57,0:30:57,SPEAKER 2, A lot.
2749,0:30:58,0:30:59,SPEAKER 1, So the people.
2750,0:30:59,0:31:02,SPEAKER 9, That really that bought those bonds and support the war.
2751,0:31:03,0:31:07,BUFFETT, At a portion of their purchasing power taken away from them.
2752,0:31:07,0:31:09,SPEAKER 1, Well there.  Wasn't any wrong with that particularly.
2753,0:31:10,0:31:10,SPEAKER 2, But.
2754,0:31:11,0:31:13,SPEAKER 7, When the country gets in the habit of doing that.
2755,0:31:15,0:31:16,SPEAKER 1, I don't think it's.
2756,0:31:17,0:31:18,SPEAKER 5, I think it's tough to.
2757,0:31:20,0:31:25,BUFFETT, Figure out where the breaking point is with society but I don't think you want to come anywhere close to it.
2758,0:31:25,0:31:30,SPEAKER 3, It's also tough to have a mass of people unemployed.  That's the tension.
2759,0:31:31,0:31:32,SPEAKER 2, Yeah.
2760,0:31:33,0:31:37,SPEAKER 1, Well that's.  That's why the.  That has to.
2761,0:31:38,0:31:40,BUFFETT, Objectives in terms of employment and.
2762,0:31:41,0:31:43,SPEAKER 1, Inflation and.  But.
2763,0:31:44,0:31:45,SPEAKER 7, They're not the ones that.
2764,0:31:46,0:31:49,SPEAKER 3, That create the deficit.  So far the system.  And work pretty well although like I say it's been so far the man who jumped off a tall building.
2765,0:31:56,0:31:57,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  It's all right.
2766,0:31:57,0:31:58,SPEAKER 3, It's the ground.
2767,0:32:00,0:32:02,SPEAKER 1, Well.  But.  But you.
2768,0:32:02,0:32:07,BUFFETT, There could be ways we can stop now at the third floor or the sixth floor.  We don't know what forward is but we know there's.
2769,0:32:07,0:32:08,SPEAKER 8, Having the ground.
2770,0:32:08,0:32:11,SPEAKER 1, But the question.  You know.
2771,0:32:12,0:32:14,BUFFETT, Politically it's very very very tempting.
2772,0:32:15,0:32:19,SPEAKER 1, To.  To both.  Appropriations and it's not fun to.
2773,0:32:21,0:32:22,SPEAKER 4, Both taxes and.
2774,0:32:22,0:32:23,SPEAKER 8, Russell long.
2775,0:32:24,0:32:30,BUFFETT, Have the Senate finance committee they got building they may have from now he said you know.  Don't tax you don't tax me tax like I'm behind the tree.
2776,0:32:31,0:32:32,SPEAKER 1, Basically.
2777,0:32:32,0:32:37,SPEAKER 8, That is the attitude.  Of.  I mean it's the reality.
2778,0:32:38,0:32:47,SPEAKER 1, Of what.  Is useful.  In politics and so far this country's.  Managed to.
2779,0:32:48,0:32:49,SPEAKER 8, Work very well with a lot of.
2780,0:32:50,0:32:50,SPEAKER 1, Things that.
2781,0:32:52,0:32:55,SPEAKER 8, Could theoretically cause a lot of problems but.
2782,0:32:55,0:32:59,BUFFETT, It doesn't mean it doesn't guarantee us the future on it and.
2783,0:32:59,0:33:00,SPEAKER 2, And.
2784,0:33:00,0:33:02,SPEAKER 9, Being the reserve currency.
2785,0:33:03,0:33:08,BUFFETT, Let's just do a lot of things but it also creates a lot of consequences if we screw it up.
2786,0:33:14,0:33:20,SPEAKER 3, We're busy a subject to death but.  It is a problem I wish we had a solution.
2787,0:33:21,0:33:24,BUFFETT, Okay well that will go to station one.
2788,0:33:24,0:33:30,SPEAKER 1, Hello.
2789,0:33:31,0:33:56,SPEAKER 2, Mr.  Buffers and Mr.  Munger my name's Connor I'm an economic student to the University of Nottingham.  My question for you to.  Today is during the pandemic we witnessed supply chain shortages especially from Asia as a result companies have chosen with political.  Tensions to move production away should companies make these decisions and should the government support them.
2790,0:34:00,0:34:36,SPEAKER 3, Trying well that's a good question yeah obviously.  It's logical if you're in business.  And you can make the thing in Mexico way cheaper.  It's natural to open a factory in Mexico and in Mexico and.  Get your parts cheaper and a lot of the all the manufacturers have done exactly that.  On the other hand.  Nobody wants to hollow out the whole country so all the manufacturing jobs are elsewhere and we're all living with a bunch of farmers.  You know like English colonies in 1820 or something.   And.  And these ideas are of course in.  In big tension.  We have.  We don't have that much foreign production.
2791,0:34:56,0:34:58,SPEAKER 1, Right Warren.  Yeah well.
2792,0:34:59,0:35:00,SPEAKER 8, But we've lost.
2793,0:35:02,0:35:10,BUFFETT, Well originally Berkshire otherwise the textile manufacturer lost because the south became feasible.  Versus the north and of course then eventually.
2794,0:35:11,0:35:15,SPEAKER 3, The south got expensive.  Sure and.
2795,0:35:16,0:35:29,BUFFETT, Society benefits and some people get killed in that sort of a situation and a rich society should take care one way or another.
2796,0:35:31,0:35:37,BUFFETT, People who worked in our shoe factories.  People working our textile companies.
2797,0:35:37,0:35:37,SPEAKER 4, I mean.
2798,0:35:37,0:35:38,SPEAKER 1, If you want to.
2799,0:35:38,0:35:40,BUFFETT, Work in our textile operation in.
2800,0:35:41,0:35:42,SPEAKER 1, In nineteen sixty.
2801,0:35:42,0:35:47,BUFFETT, Four when we took it over half our half our workers only spoke Portuguese.
2802,0:35:49,0:35:57,BUFFETT, They and they weren't getting great wages at all.  But now you could do it in the south and we were doomed.   To go out of business.  And it wasn't the fall of the worker in any way shape or form.
2803,0:36:04,0:36:05,SPEAKER 8, It wasn't the.
2804,0:36:06,0:36:08,BUFFETT, Our fault we kept trying to compete.
2805,0:36:08,0:36:11,SPEAKER 3, Well it was a TV a cheap power down there.
2806,0:36:12,0:36:12,SPEAKER 2, Sure.
2807,0:36:12,0:36:13,SPEAKER 1, Can you and a.
2808,0:36:13,0:36:22,BUFFETT, Textile is really can jail power and air conditioning change everything with the heat and those them.  Pleasure were impossible.  That's a lot of things.
2809,0:36:22,0:36:23,SPEAKER 1, But then then it moves.
2810,0:36:25,0:36:27,SPEAKER 7, Offshore in many ways and.
2811,0:36:30,0:36:35,BUFFETT, The country is better off because of it but it displaces a lot of people.
2812,0:36:36,0:36:38,SPEAKER 7, Really can't do something else.
2813,0:36:38,0:36:46,BUFFETT, Can't talk about retraining somebody is fifty five or sixty speaks only Portuguese and really tell them they're going to have a great future in new Bedford mass and.
2814,0:36:48,0:36:49,SPEAKER 9, So you don't want to be.
2815,0:36:51,0:36:52,SPEAKER 2,Glib about it. And we can afford.
2816,0:36:54,0:36:56,BUFFETT, To take care of those people.
2817,0:36:58,0:37:02,BUFFETT, We've got some systems that work reasonably well but but there's a tension between.
2818,0:37:03,0:37:04,SPEAKER 1, You know.  What about the.
2819,0:37:05,0:37:07,BUFFETT, Person that doesn't do anything and all that kind of stuff.
2820,0:37:07,0:37:08,SPEAKER 1, These are not easy.
2821,0:37:08,0:37:09,SPEAKER 9, Problems with solve.
2822,0:37:10,0:37:10,SPEAKER 8, But I would say.
2823,0:37:12,0:37:14,BUFFETT, That by and large we want the whole world.
2824,0:37:15,0:37:16,BUFFETT, Prosper we do not want to be a world.
2825,0:37:17,0:37:18,SPEAKER 7, We don't want the United States.
2826,0:37:19,0:37:20,SPEAKER 9, To be a country of.
2827,0:37:21,0:37:28,BUFFETT, Extraordinary prosperity and have the rest of the world.  No it isn't going to work and a.  Particularly working on a nuclear world.
2828,0:37:29,0:37:29,SPEAKER 7, So.  And every own feelings about it as a.  You mean person but but it doesn't.
2829,0:37:37,0:37:39,SPEAKER 1, It is not.
2830,0:37:40,0:37:45,SPEAKER 7, It can be done better and and we've got the resources to do it.
2831,0:37:45,0:37:46,SPEAKER 1, I mean.
2832,0:37:47,0:37:49,SPEAKER 6, The output.
2833,0:37:49,0:37:57,BUFFETT, Of this country.  What can be done with a lot fewer people and doing more specialized things and of course it has been the work week in the United States.
2834,0:37:57,0:38:02,SPEAKER 7, You know in my lifetime is.  Drop dramatically and people.
2835,0:38:03,0:38:03,SPEAKER 1, We'll.
2836,0:38:04,0:38:04,BUFFETT, This is a.
2837,0:38:05,0:38:06,SPEAKER 9, It will be the human lot.
2838,0:38:07,0:38:11,SPEAKER 7, Say you know.  How can I get all these things done but.
2839,0:38:11,0:38:12,SPEAKER 2, But.
2840,0:38:13,0:38:18,BUFFETT, My mother didn't.  I free kids anyplace I want to go in place.  If you're lucky and.
2841,0:38:18,0:38:18,SPEAKER 1, We've got all the.
2842,0:38:18,0:38:26,BUFFETT, Of yet a bicycle.  The world is just looking at everything moving up.  As becoming sort of a base that leaves them somewhat dissatisfied.
2843,0:38:28,0:38:28,SPEAKER 5, And.
2844,0:38:30,0:38:31,SPEAKER 1, With our prosperity.
2845,0:38:33,0:38:37,SPEAKER 7, We can do a lot of things we couldn't do.
2846,0:38:48,0:38:57,BUFFETT, I don't we'll  get the science of the terms of people and the GENI Ticket is going.
2847,0:39:18,0:39:18,SPEAKER 2, I'm forward.
2848,0:39:18,0:40:16,SPEAKER 3," Welcome to the capitalism.  Automatically with a lot of property and private hands and free trade and all that automatically creates GDP per capita that grows and helps everybody,  including the people at the bottom.  It helps everybody a lot.  But inherent in the process is a lot of pain in that free market capitalism, for instance,  to the Portuguese workers in the textbook company in New Bedford.  Nobody's ever figured out how to take all the pain out of it.  We do have government safety nets to take some of the pain out.  We make those safety nets a little bigger as time goes by.  But apart from that,  if you try and take all the pain out,  you'll also take all the gains out of it.  You won't have a growing GDP per capita.  You'll have an economy like Russia, which has  been characterized as saying they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. "
2849,0:40:17,0:40:34,BUFFETT," The other systems haven't worked better,  but it also produces more and more disparities in wealth and people that do nothing but get assets under management without actually performing anything extra. "
2850,0:40:34,0:40:35,SPEAKER 8, Make fortunes.
2851,0:40:35,0:40:38,SPEAKER 1, It's  a job of government to keep the best aspects of capitalism.  A lot of people that only speak Portuguese to suffer in the process.
2852,0:40:49,0:40:52,SPEAKER 9, The two aren't compatible politically over time.
2853,0:40:53,0:40:57,BUFFETT, We stumble along making progress on things like social security and all that.
2854,0:40:58,0:41:01,SPEAKER 7, We are a lot better often.
2855,0:41:01,0:41:02,SPEAKER 1, We are when I was born.
2856,0:41:02,0:41:14,SPEAKER 3," Net, the United States, has done a very good job of this tension between capitalistic growth and growing social safety nets.  We can be pretty proud of our country.  That  may be why we have 25% of the world's GDP starting with a half of a percent of the population in a few centuries.  It's a miracle.  It wasn't because we were smarter."
2857,0:41:27,0:41:34,SPEAKER 9," You've got to say there must be something to the system that's worked pretty well,  even though it's produced a civil war and all kinds of things. "
2858,0:41:35,0:41:42,SPEAKER 7, Women are not getting a shot at anything even after they passed the 19th amendment.
2859,0:41:43,0:41:45,SPEAKER 1, It's a  work in progress.
2860,0:41:49,0:41:57,BUFFETT," I think actually there's been progress,  but it's mankind's nature to see the things wrong with it. "
2861,0:41:58,0:42:17,SPEAKER 3," It's advanced nature to take the progress as a right,  not something to be earned or strived for,  but something that should automatically just flow in over the transom.  That attitude is poison.  It doesn't do anybody any good. "
2862,0:42:19,0:42:20,SPEAKER 5," Now I ask a certain easy question,  Becky.  This question comes from Doug DeSheel.  Since the accounting rules changed requiring Berkshire to report the change in fair value of its equity investments through the income statement,  Mr.  Buffett has repeatedly told shareholders to ignore those changes as they're not  reflective of the long-term returns that those investments will produce.  Recently, Mr.  Buffett has argued that holds a maturity accounting used by the banks to avoid reflecting the changes in fair value of bank investment portfolios in the income statement and the shareholder equity account do a disservice to its various stakeholders.  Can Mr.  Buffett elaborate on why he views market-to-market accounting differently for banks in comparison to Berkshire?"
2863,0:43:02,0:43:29,BUFFETT," I believe in both cases,  in doing it on the balance sheet and not in the income statement.  It's a very tough problem with the auditor's face,  is that obviously the income statement feeds into the balance sheet.  The balance sheet tells you whether deposits can be paid.  It tells you a lot of things.  We show it on our balance sheet. "
2864,0:43:30,0:43:35,SPEAKER 9, We believe in showing market values on our own.  We just don't believe in running it through the income account.
2865,0:43:35,0:43:41,BUFFETT," In getting there, we would put it in other comprehensive income like it was for a long time. "
2866,0:43:42,0:43:46,SPEAKER 8," I sympathize to some extent with the,  for our extent, with the audit group,  but they have to really decide whether they want the balance sheet to represent values,  except it doesn't reflect them on the upside."
2867,0:44:01,0:44:02,SPEAKER 1," If we buy a balance sheet,  we'll have to do it."
2868,0:44:02,0:44:03,SPEAKER 7, Buy a seized can and it's worth way more money.
2869,0:44:04,0:44:05,BUFFETT, So it's conservative in that sense.
2870,0:44:06,0:44:06,SPEAKER 7," Or  whether they want to have an income account that becomes meaningless to people because it really changes every five seconds.  While we're in the markets close today, but we have days."
2871,0:44:25,0:44:25,SPEAKER 2," Well,  I guess Apple was up what,  some right point, some on Friday."
2872,0:44:30,0:44:32,SPEAKER 1," I mean, that's seven billion. "
2873,0:44:32,0:44:37,SPEAKER 7," I mean, that's a crazy income account. "
2874,0:44:38,0:44:41,SPEAKER 1," It is a reflection of where we stand at that point.  And of course, if you're a bank,  where you're putting out money, really, and things that people sort of mortgages, I mean, primarily.  They're a terrible instrument for a bank to own,  but a great instrument for a  consumer to buy and build in the whole society now in a way that was entitled.  It's entirely different than the past.  You've got to pay attention to whether they've gotten out of whack in terms of what's the value, what they own, and what can be demanded out in tomorrow morning.  If we had all of them,  our money could be demanded from us tomorrow morning.  We'd have to behave a lot differently than Berkshire does."
2875,0:45:25,0:45:34,BUFFETT," I don't, I don't, I really think the way to do it is the way you recommend doing,  which is exactly what was being done until a few years ago.  I recommend the shareholders look at it that way,  but we're going to follow the rules, obviously, the SEC."
2876,0:45:43,0:46:02,SPEAKER 1," State authorities and everybody require of us.  But I'll still explain to the shareholders exactly what I would explain to my sister about what really counts at Berkshire.  And I think every management actually has an  obligation to that.  And instead of it, they go in the other direction and give them a lot of figures that are total nonsense."
2877,0:46:07,0:46:09,BUFFETT," You know, I can't imagine  some of them.  You know, even die. "
2878,0:46:12,0:46:12,SPEAKER 1, I thought was about as bad as you could.
2879,0:46:13,0:46:18,BUFFETT, But they kept going and earnings before everything.
2880,0:46:18,0:46:19,SPEAKER 1," EBE.  And so, but that doesn't change."
2881,0:46:25,0:46:37,BUFFETT," But I would tell my sister who's here in the audience, I hope.  And I should tell all the shareholders and we'll consistently do what is legal and we'll consistently say what we think is right. "
2882,0:46:38,0:46:39,SPEAKER 1, Charlie?
2883,0:46:40,0:46:42,SPEAKER 5, Yeah.  Yeah.
2884,0:46:43,0:46:52,SPEAKER 7," We want owners who understand what they own.  Now, that doesn't mean they have to understand the detail of it. "
2885,0:46:53,0:47:00,BUFFETT, But that's why we have people that have been around 50 or 60 years.  That doesn't mean that they read the 10 kills or anything like that.
2886,0:47:01,0:47:08,SPEAKER 7," But they, they feel we're telling a tool like,  you know, the little next door to us. "
2887,0:47:09,0:47:34,BUFFETT," Yeah, I don't know what the accountant's worth.  Thinking when they read that change,  it strikes me as bonkers.  Yeah, absolutely bonkers.  I don't see how anybody who understands how businesses really operated and should be operated by owning managers would have made that accounting change.  The accounts did it just because they had a wild moment.  20, 25 years ago, I suggested to the audit profession that they just.  That the audit committee asked, auditors for questions and the shareholders would know a lot more about the company if those questions were asked.  But it wasn't good for the auditors to be asked those questions because it might increase their liability if they,  if they answered them in a client didn't want them to answer them because the man even didn't want them to know they would they want a system where if they've all certain rules, they're safe.  And that's understandable."
2888,0:48:14,0:48:40,SPEAKER 3," I don't think the past year,  this rule requiring changes in marketable securities to go through the annual account quarterly.  They didn't do that to protect themselves from liability.  They just did that for some crazy reason of their own.  Yeah, I get a bunch of people who are all being drawing a lot of pay out of a big complicated system and. "
2889,0:48:40,0:48:40,SPEAKER 5, Right.
2890,0:48:40,0:48:40,SPEAKER 2," So, I think that's a good thing. "
2891,0:48:41,0:48:51,SPEAKER 3, Rising in it like so many officers in the army.  God knows what they'll do if you put them in a little room by themselves and.  Tell them to invent new accounting standards.
2892,0:48:54,0:48:57,BUFFETT," Well, to our order to remember that's Charlie talking. "
2893,0:48:57,0:48:58,SPEAKER 1, That's right.
2894,0:48:58,0:49:04,SPEAKER 8, But I agree with him.  100% like he's he's 99.
2895,0:49:05,0:49:06,SPEAKER 9, He can get away with more than I can get away with.
2896,0:49:07,0:49:11,SPEAKER 2, Oh.  Okay.
2897,0:49:11,0:49:16,BUFFETT, Station to.  But what he said is enormously important.
2898,0:49:16,0:49:18,SPEAKER 3," I mean, it just you  got to have some insights into what the whole really goes on. And even if you're counting the count."
2899,0:49:24,0:49:25,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.  Okay.
2900,0:49:26,0:49:26,BUFFETT, Station to.
2901,0:49:27,0:49:27,SPEAKER 2," Dear   Warren,  dear Charlie,  my name is Victoria Wantrop.  I am 22 years old and I study Munich at the CDTM,  the center of digital technology and management.  As your grandchildren are more in my age group.  Let me ask you.  How do you transfer your wisdom to your grandchildren and heirs?  How do you lead them to investing?  Do you see value in your children?  How do you lead them to your children?  Do you see value in investing as a family or individually?  Thank you. "
2902,0:50:02,0:50:04,BUFFETT, I'm a Charlie to the answering.
2903,0:50:04,0:50:05,SPEAKER 1, He's got more.
2904,0:50:06,0:50:07,SPEAKER 2," Well, I have my grandchildren,  but."
2905,0:50:08,0:50:10,SPEAKER 5," I  am quite philosophical about my grandchildren not thinking exactly the way I do.  It seems to me that's almost the natural course of life.  And I just lived with the children and I have to be a friend.  My life my own way and they can observe it as an example if they want to.  And if they don't,  they can try some other way.  I don't like it when they try some other way.  And I have to pretend that I like some of the boyfriends and girlfriends I don't like.  But I just struggle through like everybody else.  And usually I just bite my tongue and keep silent.  That's my way of handling."
2906,0:50:55,0:51:01,SPEAKER 3," Well, I would say that I think that in my case,  my three children have grown a lot smarter than the last 30 years and I think I've grown smarter. And I know, but you needed a lot of help."
2907,0:51:09,0:51:10,SPEAKER 8, That is for sure.
2908,0:51:10,0:51:12,SPEAKER 4," No,  I would totally acknowledge that.  That's why I had the room to go."
2909,0:51:16,0:51:18,SPEAKER 8," I mean, I had a plenty room for a group. "
2910,0:51:18,0:51:21,SPEAKER 6, But I all had a lot to grow.
2911,0:51:21,0:51:30,SPEAKER 3," I worked a year for U.S.  Steel which was the first year.  In their fabrication department in Los Angeles,  a big operation."
2912,0:51:55,0:51:55,SPEAKER 2,"The thing was utterly doomed.  And three years later,  it went back to Greenfield.  So the whole thing was raised to the ground.  I did not see it coming.  Now, I would be that ignorant.  And that as  I was at that age,  it was a sin.  And my professors,  by and large, were even more ignorant than I was. And we just know that he had observed the basic economics of business in a scientific way at all when I was young."
2913,0:52:05,0:52:08,BUFFETT," Well, if we're getting into confession time,  I have to tell you, it's 3.30. "
2914,0:52:09,0:52:11,SPEAKER 8, So we don't want to keep going on.
2915,0:52:12,0:52:14,BUFFETT, Who knows what we'll be saying in another half hour.
2916,0:52:14,0:52:30,BUFFETT," I thank you all very much for coming.  At 4.30, we will have the shareholders meeting here.  And we're continuing to sell this for another 20 or 25 minutes. "
2917,0:52:30,0:52:32,SPEAKER 1," We've already broken all kinds of records,  but let's really make it tough for comparisons next year.  And I think, again, I thank you for coming come next year. And maybe we'll."
2918,0:00:00,0:00:59,BUFFETT,"I think that the incentives in bank regulation are so messed up and so many people have an  interest in having them messed up, that it's totally crazy. The message has been very poor, it's been poor by the politicians, who sometimes have  an interest in having it poor. It's been poor by the agencies, and I'd say it's been poor by the press. I mean, you shouldn't have so many people that misunderstand the fact that although  there may be a debt ceiling, it's going to get changed. Although there's a $250,000 limit on FDIC, the FDIC and the U. S. government and the American  public have no interest in having a bank fail and have deposits actually lost by people A lot of things that could happen out of the present situation, depositors will not lose  money, stockholders and debt holders of the holding company and all that, they should. lose money And if people borrow out on commercial real estate, and now it isn't, the loans aren't. getting extended, they should leave It's too bad."
2919,0:01:19,0:01:26,SPEAKER 4,"I mean, that's part of borrowing on 100% margin, which is what people have been doing in commercial  real estate You've got to have the penalties hit the people that cause the problems, and if they. took risks that they shouldn't have, it needs to fall on them if you're going to change how people are going to behave in the future."
2920,0:01:38,0:01:53,SPEAKER 5,"Apple has a position with consumers where they're paying, you know, maybe they're paying  $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for having a second car. And if they had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car."
2921,0:01:59,0:02:03,SPEAKER 8,"I mean, it's an extraordinary problem We don't have anything like that that we own 100% of, but we're very, very, very happy to  have 5. 6 or whatever it may be percent, and we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up."
2922,0:02:15,0:02:19,SPEAKER 4,"It's like adding $100 million to our earnings, I mean, our share of the earnings, and they use their earnings to buy out our partners, which we're glad to see them sell out, too. I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that is going into artificial intelligence. I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well It can do all kinds of things, and when something can do all kinds of things, I get a little. bit worried, because I know we won't be able to un-invent it There's been some tension in the economic relationship of the United States and China."
2923,0:02:47,0:03:24,SPEAKER 3,"I think that tension has been wrongly created on both sides. I think we're equally guilty of being stupid. There's one thing we should do, it's get along with China, and we should have a lot of free  trade with China, in our mutual interest, and I just can't imagine. It's just so obvious There's so much safety and so much creativity that's possible. Think of what Apple has done by engaging in a partnership with China as a big supplier. It's been good for Apple and good for China. That's the kind of business we ought to be doing with China, and more of it. Everything that increases the tension between the two companies is stupid, stupid, stupid,  and ought to be stopped on each side, and each side ought to respond to the other side's  stupidity with reciprocal kindness The world's changing, new things coming along, don't take away the opportunities."
2924,0:04:07,0:04:41,SPEAKER 5,"What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. I would say that, well, the 58 years we've been running Berkshire, I would say there's  been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things, and they do big dumb things,  and the reason they do it, to some extent, is because they can get money from other people  so much easier than when we started We will not be making any offer for control of Occidental, but we love the shares we have."
2925,0:04:41,0:05:07,BUFFETT,"We may or may not own more in the future, but we certainly have warrants on, which we  got as part of the original deal, on a very substantial amount of stock, around $59 a  share, and those warrants last a long time, and I'm glad we have them I think Elon Musk overestimates himself, but he is very talented, so he's overestimating  somebody who doesn't need to overestimate to be very talented."
2926,0:05:07,0:05:35,SPEAKER 3,"He would not have achieved what he has in life if he hadn't tried for unreasonably extreme  objectives. He likes taking on the impossible job and doing it We're different. Warren and I are looking for the easy job that we can identify If we can do it playing tic-tac-toe, we'll do it, you know. We have a wholly different way of going about it But we don't want to compete with Elon in a lot of things."
2927,0:05:55,0:05:55,SPEAKER 1, We don't want that much failure.
