{"prompt":" Warren Buffett needs little introduction.  He's the godfather of modern-day investing.  For nearly 50 years,  Buffett has run Berkshire Hathaway,  which owns over 60 companies like GEICO and Dairy Queen,  plus minority stakes in Apple,  Coca-Cola and many others.  His $82.5 billion fortune makes him the third  richest person in the world,  and he's vowed to give nearly all of it away.  The Oracle of Omaha is here to talk about what shaped his investment strategy and how to master today's market.  I'm Andy Serwer.  Welcome to a special edition of Influencers from Omaha,  Nebraska.  It's my pleasure to welcome Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.  Warren, welcome.   Thanks for coming.   So let's start off and talk about the economy a little bit.  And obviously we've been on a good long run here.   A very long run.  And yet, does that surprise you?  And what would be the signs that you would look for to see that things were winding down?  Well, I look at a lot of figures just in connection with our businesses.  I like to get numbers.  So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses.  But that doesn't tell me what the economy is going to do six months from now or three months from now.  It tells me what's going on now with our businesses.  And it really doesn't make any difference  in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses,  what those numbers tell me.  They're interesting,  but they're not guidance to me.  If we buy a business,  we're going to hold it forever.  So we're going to have good years,  bad years, in between years, maybe a disastrous year, some year.  And we care a lot about the price.  We do not care about the next 12 months.   But are you surprised at how long this economy has been expanding?  ->","completion":" I've been surprised by all kinds of things in the last 10 years about the economy.  I mean, I don't think there was  any economist I've ever read that  talked about negative interest rates for long periods of time.  I mean, if you go back and read Keynes or you  read Samuelson, you read any of them, they do not  get into a negative rate  environment.  I think now there's still $11 trillion of government debt around the world that's at  a negative rate.  So  we've never seen it before.  And we've never seen at least the conventional  wisdom on a sustained period of  long and growing deficits while the economy is getting better,  extremely low interest rates,  and really very little inflation.  So something different is happening,  but something different happens all the time.  And that's one reason economic predictions just don't enter into our decisions.  Charlie Munger, my partner, and I,  in 54 years now,  we've never made a decision based on an economic prediction.  We make business predictions about what individual businesses will do over time.  And we compare that to what we have to pay for.  But we have never said yes to something because we thought  the economy was going to do well in the next year or two years.  And we've never said no to anything because we were right in the middle of a panic even if the price was right.   All right.  So you don't pay much attention to the dismal scientists then, I guess.  Well,  I pay none in the sense of as a guideline to doing anything.  It's entertainment.  I mean, you know, it's like going to a variety show or something like that.  But  I just don't know  of any economist that  actually has  bought businesses successfully or done well in stocks.  Paul Samuelson did.  And you may know he was a big shareholder at Berkshire.  But  it's,  you know, they make guesses.  And there's so many variables.  I mean, in the hard sciences,  you know that  if an apple falls from a tree,  that it isn't going to change over the centuries because of anything or political developments or 400  other variables that go in.  But when you get into economics, there's so many variables. And the truth is you've got to expect good times and bad times  in business.  And if you were to buy an auto dealership and you're,  you know, wherever you live locally or a McDonald's franchise or anything like that,  you wouldn't try and time the purchase.  You try and make the right purchase at the right price and you want to be sure you got a good business.  But you wouldn't say I'm going to buy it because  growth this year is going to be 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent or something.  Fair enough.\n"}

And, you know, you worry too much about whether somebody says this is going to be a year of low prices because  exports are being affected or anything like that.  You know,  you buy a farm and you hold  it for, I've got one farm that I bought in the 1980s and my son runs it.

But it's all about the farm.  And if  it just doesn't,  I don't care about economic predictions on  or anything of the sort.  I do care that over,  over the years it's well tended to in terms  of rotating crops.  And I hope yields get better,  which they generally have.

President Trump was a business executive.  So two questions.  Is a business executive the right kind of person to be president?  And what characteristics do you look for for a president that you would support?  Well,  I think  a business executive can be the right person.  But I don't think that because they're a business executive that you give them extra points.  And number one, I want a president that wakes up every morning and realizes that the greatest threat to a country,  which has got all kinds of things going for it,  are weapons of mass destruction.  And that we live in a world where people,  organizations,  and occasionally countries could have people that would like to wipe out a large percentage of the American people or maybe other  countries as well.  And that you now have capabilities,  which I always thought,  until recently, I classified as nuclear, chemical, and biological.  But I think you have to add cyber now.  If  you have some evil genius someplace that,  for  crazy reasons, just like  happened with anthrax back,  who knows what motivates somebody that starts sending  anthrax out in their letters.  And if you have somebody that thinks it'd be great to send a false alarm to the Russians and  to the US that the other side was launching or something of the sort,  it's a very, very dangerous world.  It's a wonderful world,  but it has dangers now that started in August  of 1945 and when Einstein said,  you know, this changes everything in the world except  how men think.  And  so I want a president that has that same filter that  all of these other things are important,  but  protecting the country and reducing the chance of successful use of weapons of mass destruction against us  is the number one job.  And I think  most of the presidents,  I've talked to a couple of them about it over the years, and I  really think that they do realize that they may get lost in the events of every day as they go along.  And then beyond that,  I want a president that  has two objectives with the economy.  One is to make sure that this marvelous goose we have keeps laying more golden eggs.  And then I want a president that also feels that if GDP is $60 ,000 per capita in the United States,  that nobody should get left behind.

But there's a lot of games I miss.  I would have missed Microsoft even if I'd gotten to know Bill earlier.  Those just aren't my games.  I don't worry about the things I miss that are outside my circle of competence  of evaluating.  I have missed things that are within my circle.  And that's a terrible mistake.  Those are my biggest mistakes.  You haven't seen them.  But I don't...  It's not a mistake because I miss Netscape or something like that at all.  I would say that maybe 5% of the companies or 10% of the companies at most are within an area of my circle of competence.  There's something I should be able to understand.   All right.  Well, let me switch gears then and ask you about leverage a little bit.  And  corporate debt people are concerned about.  People are concerned about federal debt at $22 trillion.  Should we reduce,  let's just say, the federal debt?  And how would we do that?   Well,  if you're running a deficit getting close to 5%  when things are really good,  that's a new world.  And neither the Republicans or Democrats are particularly concerned about it.  And we're not having a lot of inflation.  That wasn't supposed to happen.  But it's happening.  That's why I say you don't really...  You don't want to get hung up on  trying to make an economic analysis because  nobody's any good at...  You don't get rich doing that.  If you look at...  I mentioned that Forbes list.  If you get on the list,  the number of people who have  done that by economic analysis,  I think, are just about as old as Sean there.   Okay.  Fair enough.  Income inequality, wealth inequality, you've talked about the earned income tax credit.  Is there more to it than that?  Should we adjust tax policy?  It seems to be going the other way right now.  ->","completion":" Well, it is going the other way.  But I think the earned income tax credit  is the best way to put money in the pockets of people that  don't fit well into the market system,  but that are perfectly decent citizens and that  have made a good bit of the success somebody like I've had with Berkshire or something  possible.  It wouldn't have happened without the America we have.  And if you go back 200  years  and we're all working on...  80% of us are working on farms.  The person that's the best at that,  working on that farm,  whatever it may be,  is worth maybe twice the ones that's the worst.  I mean, that's the difference between super talent and no talent in the farm economy,  picking cotton or whatever it may be.  Now,  if you're the best  middleweight fighter in the world,  you may get 20 or 30 million dollars.  And if you are just a good citizen,  raise nice kids,  help in the neighborhood and everything else,  but you don't have market-related skills,  you'd be good on that farm still.  And you would be earning something  comparable to most of the people around you.  But you don't have something now that as it gets more  and more specialized, and it's going to continue to get more specialized,  you want two things for that person.  You want them to have a decent life.  I mean, they live in a country with  60,000 of GDP per person.  You want them to have a decent life, and they can.  I also think you want them to have a feeling of accomplishment.  So you want them to have a job,  assuming that they're not handicapped in some way.  You want them to have a job.  But the minimum wage would be one way,  say, well, we'll make sure that they have enough money in their pocket.  But  that's got a lot of effects in disturbing the market system.  They just need more cash.  They don't need a higher wage,  they need more cash in their pocket.  And the government at  a relatively low cost  can provide a decent living for anybody that's working 40 hours  a week and has a couple of children.  And  we've gone in that direction,  and it's sort of bipartisan.  I mean, I find both Republicans and Democrats for it.  I think it would be better not to  have one annual payment,  you know, that they get it monthly.  And I think there's various  things you could do.  But you want it.  You want them to feel part of the system,  and you want to get them,  have them get as  more and more of these golden eggs are laid,  you want them to get  a little more of their share. \n"}

If you look back,  I was very active in the last half of  September and early October,  and then I wrote that article in later October.  I knew it was  going to get bad.  I wrote the article it was going to get bad,  but I didn't think the stock market  would react as much as it did between then and March.  So I had more or less used  up our powder well before the bottom was hit.   That's interesting.  How have you avoided not getting back into GE more recently?  I mean, I'm sure that they've reached out to you.  Everyone says, oh, why doesn't Warren Buffett  invest in GE and save it and take it to the promised land?  It's this great American company.  ->","completion":" Well, actually, I think Larry actually is doing a good job. \n"}

He didn't want somebody buying a quart of milk with somebody behind him with a basket of $200 worth of goods waiting for that.  So he put in a membership fee,  and by putting in a membership fee,  he killed all the drop-in business,  the business that belonged to the 7-Eleven.  We want Berkshire to keep out people who have expectations about us that are different than ours.  I mean,  good for them, and I hope they find somebody they fit.

We want Berkshire to keep out people who have expectations about us that are different than ours.  I mean,  good for them, and I hope they find somebody they fit.  But if you're going to run a church,  you want your seats to be filled by people that are  generally want to listen to your form of religion.  And you don't want it to change every week and say,  gee, I need a new group,  and I'll go out and talk to a bunch of investors and get them to come to my church this Sunday.  Because there's only so many seats in the church.  There's a million six hundred and forty-five thousand or so  A-equivalent shares, and those are the seats.  And I want them occupied by people that are on the same page I am.   The church of Berkshire.

{"prompt":" Your own investors.  Yeah.   Well, that's important.  You know, 54.  Well, if you go back to when I started my partnership in 1956 that  Berkshire came out of,  there were seven people sitting there at a table having dinner,  relatives primarily.  And I said, here's the partnership agreement.  It's done under Nebraska law.  It's four or five pages.  You don't need to read it.  But I said, here's a little half page,  what I call the ground rules.  And I want you to read these.  And if you feel okay about that,  about the interaction, what the expectations are and all of that sort of thing,  then we'll join forces.  And if you don't,  it's fine.  Other people have, you know, but we don't, we shouldn't be partners.  I mean,  you know, if I'm going to have a partnership with somebody,  I want it to be compatible.  It is, you know, and when you have a  public company, you can't control it.  I can't control who comes in.  I can't control some guy that comes in and thinks we were going to pay big dividends  or split the stock or something like that.  So by my actions and my communications and everything,  I want to attract the people that  from the public market that I want,  and I want to keep the others away.  Costco was built,  Sol Price, who started the Price Club and that thing.  He sat down and figured out the customer he didn't want.  And he set up a system that would keep away the customer he didn't want.  Who did he not want?

And he says, and this is sort of along the lines of what you were just saying,  Warren, but do you think that U.S.  and China will be able to resolve their differences or are conflicts unavoidable?   Well, I don't think conflicts are unavoidable, but I think,  I think  it has to be  active thinking on the part of  every hugely powerful country.  And Russia is hugely powerful.  I mean, 90% of the nuclear arms in the world are between U.S.  and Russia.  So they, they have to recognize that  the best world for them is one where they don't try and grab all the apples basically.  And we have to recognize that.  And, and we can't,  in the United States,  we can't think that either our ideas run the world,  you know, or we started getting aggressive about things  and China can't think that Russia can't think that.   And,  and that's obvious.  You just have to make things,  you got to be sure things don't escalate.  You know, you have World War I,  you know, with an Archduke, you know, I mean, you get,  you get these,  you can get chance incidents and you really want to,  I asked one of the presidents one time,  you know, in terms of what he would do if awakened in the middle of the night with  somebody coming to him and saying,  absolutely,  you know, somebody else had launched,  you know,  would you launch on that?  And you've got  10 minutes to decide.  I wouldn't want to have that responsibility,  but, but you want to make sure you don't get to that point.  Right, right.  Would you ever make a big acquisition in China?  And if not, aren't you missing a huge  portion of the world?   Yeah, the answer is we would.  Yeah, we would.   Have you looked?  ->","completion":" We've been made aware of some things, yeah. \n"}

I want to talk about the letter.  Obviously, one of the things that you touch on in the letter is when people should be buying stocks.  We're going to dig into a lot of it.  But when you're looking at the futures down about 818 points this morning,  I think probably the first thing viewers want to hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus,  if this is a reason to panic and if you are worried about this.  Well,  I don't know I have any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus.  The very first day I bought stocks was March 12th, 1941,  40, 40, 42.  And the stocks were down about 2 percent that day,  as it turned out.  Unfortunately, I bought in the morning.

It may not change things over the five or 10 year span of things.

If I knew what the market was going to do,  obviously.  But you don't I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.  I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.  Everybody, when they buy a stock,  if you're going to buy,  say, General Motors,  it has a billion,  four hundred million shares out.  You should be able to take a yellow pad like you have there.  And on one page, say, let's say it's selling for 30.  It isn't selling that low,  but that'd be 42 billion.  You should say I am buying the General Motors company for 42 billion dollars because.  And you should get it on a piece of paper.  And then if you want to have a shepherd piece of paper,  since I think I know what the stock market is going to do,  so I know whether it will be higher or lower.  But you don't  you don't have that.  But if I worry that the economy is going to slow down,  not just for the quarter,  but for the year,  that would impact how many cars I think they may be able to sell or even produce.  ->","completion":" I'll guarantee cars are going to slow down someday.  They in 1932, General Motors  had 19000 dealers.  That's more than all the auto dealers in the United States today.  There are only one hundred and twenty five million people,  but they had 19000 dealers.  They produced  or sold.  And there was one month,  I think, when they sold less than a tenth of a car,  right at a tenth of a car per dealer.  That was a terrific time to buy General Motors.  And forget about the market.  If you can predict the market,  you don't read balance sheets.  You don't need to read anything.  You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper.  That is for sure.  And you really can't.  You certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.  But you're buying businesses.  And if you plan to buy a local service station yesterday and it was closing day,  I don't think you'd tear your hair out or anything like that.  You'd have already looked at where it was located and the contract that they had with the suppliers and made a decision on competition.  People,  because they can make decisions every second in stocks,  whereas they can't with farms,  they think an investment in stocks is different than an investment in a business or an investment in a farm or investment in an apartment house.  But it isn't.  If you get your money's worth in terms of future earning power over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years,  you're going to have made a good investment.  And you can't pick them from day to day.  If you can do that, you can. \n"}

And if it gives you a chance to buy something that you like and you can buy it  even cheaper, then it's your good luck, basically.  Although there are a lot of people who look at the market and they say,  look, I want to buy,  but I don't want to buy when the market's sitting at new highs,  when it's been hitting new records every day.  Maybe it's off 800 points this morning,  but maybe there's more of a decline to come because the effect of the coronavirus is going to be an impact on the global economy.  IMF said that over the weekend.  You are going to see weakness as not only China,  but other countries try and address this.  You're right.  It may not change things over the five or 10 year span of things.  But if I think that I can buy something for potentially 10 percent cheaper,  maybe more than that,  if I wait a week or a month,  maybe that's what I'm sitting around.  Well, if you think that,  then you've got to you're going to get fabulously rich if you're right.  All you have to do is just keep buying at 10 day intervals and keep taking your 10 day prediction.  If I knew what the market was going to do,  obviously.  But you don't I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.  I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.  Everybody, when they buy a stock,  if you're going to buy,  say, General Motors,  it has a billion,  four hundred million shares out.  You should be able to take a yellow pad like you have there.  And on one page, say, let's say it's selling for 30.  It isn't selling that low,  but that'd be 42 billion.  You should say I am buying the General Motors company for 42 billion dollars because.  And you should get it on a piece of paper.  And then if you want to have a shepherd piece of paper,  since I think I know what the stock market is going to do,  so I know whether it will be higher or lower.  But you don't  you don't have that.  But if I worry that the economy is going to slow down,  not just for the quarter,  but for the year,  that would impact how many cars I think they may be able to sell or even produce.   I'll guarantee cars are going to slow down someday.  They in 1932, General Motors  had 19000 dealers.  That's more than all the auto dealers in the United States today.  There are only one hundred and twenty five million people,  but they had 19000 dealers.  They produced  or sold.  And there was one month,  I think, when they sold less than a tenth of a car,  right at a tenth of a car per dealer.  That was a terrific time to buy General Motors.  And forget about the market.  If you can predict the market,  you don't read balance sheets.  You don't need to read anything.  You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper.  That is for sure.  And you really can't.  You certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.  But you're buying businesses.  And if you plan to buy a local service station yesterday and it was closing day,  I don't think you'd tear your hair out or anything like that.  You'd have already looked at where it was located and the contract that they had with the suppliers and made a decision on competition.  People,  because they can make decisions every second in stocks,  whereas they can't with farms,  they think an investment in stocks is different than an investment in a business or an investment in a farm or investment in an apartment house.  But it isn't.  If you get your money's worth in terms of future earning power over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years,  you're going to have made a good investment.  And you can't pick them from day to day.  If you can do that, you can.   Well,  I haven't met anybody yet that  knows how to do it.  You made a point of that in the letter this year where you highlighted a book that was written by Edgar Lawrence Smith back in 1924.  And you said until he came along,  nobody really realized the compound interest effect of buying stocks,  not just buying businesses,  but buying stocks themselves.  ->","completion":" Edgar Lawrence Smith changed the world with that book.

Edgar Lawrence Smith changed the world with that book.  And the people have forgotten all about it now,  although in the 1920s it became more and more gospel as the boom went on.   But  Edgar Lawrence Smith  set out to write a book on bonds versus stocks.  And he said he went in with the idea that bonds would be a better investment in times of deflation and stocks would be a better investment in times of inflation.  And the first line of his book was to say that he'd been wrong,  but he had enough sense to look at his evidence.  I think Darwin said,  if you found evidence that was contrary to what you already believed,  write it down in 30 minutes or your mind will just block it out.  People have a great resistance to new evidence.  And he said, if a stock yields 4%,  the bond yields 4%,  which was what he was talking about then,  the stock was going to outperform the bonds because there were retained earnings that were building beyond that yield. And that has been true for a long,  long time, but nobody paid any attention to it.  We don't get rich on our dividends that we receive,  although we're happy to receive them.  We get rich on  the fact that the retained earnings are used to build new earning power,  repurchase  shares, which increases your ownership in the company.  And Berkshire has retained earnings ever since we started.  That's the only reason Berkshire is worth a lot more,  is we retain earnings.

I mean, if his premise was that stocks are always going to be a better investment than bonds,  that's kind of what you hear today,  which we've been hearing for a while is,  Tina, there is no alternative,  right?  You have to buy stocks because bond yields are so low,  because interest rates are so low.  Well,  if you look at the present situation,  we've talked about this before,  that you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.  That doesn't have to be the case.  I mean, but it's usually been the case in America,  very usually in the case.  And if you buy a 30 year bond today with a yield 2 percent,  you're paying 50 times earnings for an investment where the earnings can't go up for 30 years.  Now, if somebody said, I want to sell you a stock that's at 50 times earnings,  the earnings can't go up for 30 years,  you'd say that doesn't sound very good.  But stocks are way better than 30 year bonds.  I mean, that's clear.  And that's one of the  alternatives people have.  People really have  three basic alternatives, short term cash, which is an option of doing something later on,  long term bonds or long term stocks.  And stocks are cheaper than bonds.  Charlie said recently, Charlie Munger, the vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway,  had his Daily Journal meeting just a couple of weeks ago.

I'm sure it's accentuated,  but they've been affected by they were affected by tariffs.  They're affected by taxes.  They're affected by the most thing is they're affected by competitors in supply and demand over time.

I do think that not only our businesses,  but American business generally,  we're doing fabulously better 30 years from now or 20 years from now.  And the the long term is very,  in my view, is very easy to predict in the general way,  but an important way.  I don't think there's any way to predict what the stock market will do 10 minutes from now,  10 days from now or 10 months from now.  So I work on what I think I'm able to do and as desirable as it might be to know what was going to happen 10 minutes from now.  That's just not something I'll ever be able to master.  So fortunately,  I can come to a pretty firm conclusion that  20 or 30 years from now,  America business and probably over the world will be far better than it is now. \n"}
{"prompt":" We are here,  Warren, with you at Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters building.  This is upstairs in the room that's called the Cloud Room.  And this is a room where you often take students to kind of talk to them about questions they have when they come to visit you.  You also do some other things up here, too.  Other presentations.   Yeah, I had students there for dozens of years and  for many years, 40 schools would come in.  They'd come in groups of eight  at five days.  I spent a year and they come from all over the world.  We have them from Peru.  We have them from China.  We had from Israel.  And we had a good time, obviously.  I guess I've given it up now.  I but I I started teaching when I was 21 and I when I got to about 88,  I thought I'd take a rest.   Well, there are a lot of questions that are coming in from viewers that have been hitting here today.  They're waking up this morning looking at the stock market indicated down by almost 800 points for the Dow.  We're actually off our worst levels of the morning,  which is something to say when you're still looking at the Dow down by about seven hundred and eighty six points.  But people have a lot of questions about the economy.  They're wondering what's happening right now,  particularly with the coronavirus out there.  You have a lot of economic data at your fingertips because not only are the many businesses that Berkshire owns,  but the businesses you own pieces in.  What are you seeing right now around the globe?   Well, it affects various businesses.  I'm I would I would say that I received commentary.  I get some commentary monthly with from from almost all of the companies and a good many of them had some comment about how it was affecting them.  And however, it was affecting them at that time.  I'm sure it's accentuated,  but they've been affected by they were affected by tariffs.  They're affected by taxes.  They're affected by the most thing is they're affected by competitors in supply and demand over time.

Can I ask why?  Only because I did get a number of questions.  I know.   Well, I can understand that.  But the we just don't we don't want to give any advice on what we're doing because I could change what I'm doing tomorrow.  So we we talk about everything except we don't give stock advice.  OK,  I'll try one more from Dickinson just because I think I got 15 or 20 different questions on this.  Berkshire owns thirty two point five eight billion of Bank of America and seventeen point three nine billion of Wells Fargo.  One position's been increasing while the other's been decreasing.  Does Warren like Bank of America twice as much as Wells Fargo?  And how should shareholders see the holdings?  Yeah, well, I think they've seen that we bought  we bought Bank of America and we sold some Wells Fargo.  All right.  Let me ask you a broader question that comes in just on interest rates and the impact that that might have as well.  Veroon Jane writes in on Facebook.  Hi, I'm a huge fan and a student of Mr.  Buffett.  Please ask him what impact does the zero interest rate environment across places like Japan and Europe have on their banks,  whether the business is still good and does the prolonged low interest rate regime in the United States hurt the prospects of American banks  like J.P.  Morgan, et cetera?  And in such circumstances,  do Indian banks, which have high return on equity,  look attractive to Mr.  Buffett?  ->","completion":" Yeah, well, I can't comment on that.  But generally speaking,  with a lot of but  there are a lot  of other variables, too.  But the banks are going to make more money if there's if there  are higher rates with a with a steeper curve.  The curve makes  is more important.  In other words, the 10 year versus  short term rates  may make more difference than the absolute level. \n"}

Can I ask why?  Only because I did get a number of questions.  I know.   Well, I can understand that.  But the we just don't we don't want to give any advice on what we're doing because I could change what I'm doing tomorrow.  So we we talk about everything except we don't give stock advice.  OK,  I'll try one more from Dickinson just because I think I got 15 or 20 different questions on this.  Berkshire owns thirty two point five eight billion of Bank of America and seventeen point three nine billion of Wells Fargo.  One position's been increasing while the other's been decreasing.  Does Warren like Bank of America twice as much as Wells Fargo?  And how should shareholders see the holdings?  Yeah, well, I think they've seen that we bought  we bought Bank of America and we sold some Wells Fargo.  All right.  Let me ask you a broader question that comes in just on interest rates and the impact that that might have as well.  Veroon Jane writes in on Facebook.  Hi, I'm a huge fan and a student of Mr.  Buffett.  Please ask him what impact does the zero interest rate environment across places like Japan and Europe have on their banks,  whether the business is still good and does the prolonged low interest rate regime in the United States hurt the prospects of American banks  like J.P.  Morgan, et cetera?  And in such circumstances,  do Indian banks, which have high return on equity,  look attractive to Mr.  Buffett?   Yeah, well, I can't comment on that.  But generally speaking,  with a lot of but  there are a lot  of other variables, too.  But the banks are going to make more money if there's if there  are higher rates with a with a steeper curve.  The curve makes  is more important.  In other words, the 10 year versus  short term rates  may make more difference than the absolute level.   But  ->","completion":" American banks have made very good money with very low interest rates around the world.  If you look in the UK or Europe or Japan,  even lower rates have made it pretty tough for banks.  The returns on equity are not as high and they have to use more leverage  to even get the same returns.  And I don't like that as well. \n"}

If you are talking about the curve that we're looking at this morning,  the five year, two year is inverted.  Two year ten is not right now,  but the 10 years below one point four  percent this morning.  And think of the 10 year at one point four percent.  That means you're paying 70 times earnings for for something that can't increase its earnings for 10 years.  Now, somebody somebody can do with a stock and said, you know, we this is a terrific  stock.  It sells at 70 times earnings.  The earnings can't go up for 10 years.  You'd say, well, explain that to me again.  Right.  But  no, the interest that we've never seen a situation like this in the world.  Literally.  I mean, you can go back and read Keynes and you can read Adam Smith and you can read,  you know, all the great ones.  And they don't talk about negative interest rate.  It never cost their might.  How much supply and demand all these marginal costs.  But brilliant economists never really anticipated that you would have negative.  And you've got 13 trillion or something like that worldwide at negative interest rates.  And we don't know what that means.  And we've got a lot of people who speculate what it means.  But 10 years from now or 15 years from now,  we'll look back and say,  well, it's obvious what we have under that.  And we'll we'll see it.  But it is not a normal situation.  And it's it's well,  interest rates are the basis of all value.  I mean, you know, that if if you knew interest rates were going to be zero for a hundred years,  you would think 1 percent was a great rate of return.  But you also would know if you bought something was yielding 1 percent or  that was what it paid and rates went to 8 percent,  you'd lose practically all your capital.  So it's an enormous factor.  And we don't know the answer.  Central banks don't know the answer.  All we know is that it it's been useful in stimulating things and particularly asset prices now for 10 years.  And what we thought was temporary in 2008  and nine in the way of monetary policy to stimulate,  we've just put our foot on the gas even further.  The whole world has.  You made a point in the letter of saying that you don't know how long these interest rates will last.  You and Charlie never try and figure these things out.

What's your response to that line of logic?  Well,  conglomerates have had a bad name and for good reason over the years.  I mean, I closed my partnership up  at the end of the 1960s and there was a run,  a very abusive run in conglomerates where they played with numbers and they had dirty pooling,  as they call it,  of accounting.  They wanted to have their stocks up and put out stories to do it so they could issue more stock.  They were kind of chain letter arrangements.  There have been a lot of bad conglomerates and probably disproportionately so compared to the sort of honest to God single industry businesses over time.  We don't think we're that kind of a conglomerate.  We've certainly never wanted to issue shares.  We've never touted shares.  It's done for business reasons in our case.  The interesting thing is, of course,  is the American public has been going wild in their enthusiasm for conglomerates  in the last few years,  if you think about it.  I mean, it's been an  incredibly popular area,  but they call them index funds.  You buy 500 businesses.  I'm trying to figure out what you're talking about.  ->","completion":" Yeah, well, 500 businesses all put together.  I mean, that's the ultimate conglomerate,  isn't it?  I mean, I've recommended index funds to lots of people,  and when they do it,  they're buying into 500 businesses and they're going to have 500 businesses a year from now and five years from now.  And they think that group of businesses will do very well.  And I think our group of businesses will do OK. \n"}
{"prompt":" Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?   Well, we certainly won't be selling.  And now we may we could easily be buying something.  Sure.

You can look back at Bill Ackman's experience with the Canadian Pacific Railway and kind of wonder if he is building up a position because he would like to see you take a more active role there.  Well, we notice what other railroads earn and when their margins are better.  I mean, and we certainly put way less pressure on  than Wall Street might who would want it next week.  But we,  our managers are well aware of what's going on in other industries.  And we've made changes where we don't think some businesses are performing as well as they should.

And we decide how much they distribute,  where the capital moves.  And sometimes it moves from one industry to another.

But it isn't like it's something we can't do.   Here's the latest on the coronavirus.  China reported an additional 150 deaths and 409 new cases overnight.  South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after the number of cases there ballooned from 31 to more than 750 in less than a week.  Stocks  in Asia falling overnight.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell one point eight percent.  South Korea's Cosby fell nearly three point nine percent.  Shares of South Korea's two largest airlines down as they canceled flights to the city of Daegu,  where many of the new cases were detected.  Meantime,  Italy's government is scrambling to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of Asia.  Stocks there were lower overnight.  The government placed at least 10 towns in northern Italy under quarantine and canceled the last few days of the Venice Carnival.  Elsewhere in Italy, schools, museums, universities and cinemas were closed and major soccer matches were canceled.  At this point,  I mean, Boris Johnson out earlier today and are saying that the risk to UK citizens just over there remains low.  I would say that  our officials would say that here,  too.  The risk to the U.S.  citizens remains low.  But there's a significant difference between supply chain disruption slowing dozens and dozens and actually hundreds of companies.  Absolutely.  And that's dampening global growth.  What worries me is that we don't know three,  three months, six months, nine months, if it ever gets to the point where we start to see in a lot of  countries around the world,  these these break outs where they don't even know the origin of some of these.  And if they multiply like that,  that's when I think it could really get at this point.  It's still a it's still a global growth slowdown.  Nobody in most of the world is worried that they're going to catch coronavirus.  Right.  And they can't go out and they can't go to the movies or the health club or to a restaurant.  But that I just wonder,  we don't know.  There are major travel that's being changed right now.  Conferences are being canceled.  There was an article in Time magazine speculating when the weather the Olympics in Japan over the summer will be canceled.  So there's real implications here that could reverberate.  Having said that, the farther we get to the spring,  the better it gets in terms of weather.  There's a whole sort of it about how the flu,  you know, you know, I was looking at Jim's some of Jim's tweets earlier.  If you go too far with with the the fear and the panic,  you're accused of one thing.  If you don't go far enough,  you're accused of the other thing.  So we really just need to sit here and each day report on the facts and try to remain attached.  But there's something something about a pandemic that just is different than other black swans.  It's it's it's a frightening prospect.  Anyway, let's get right back to our guest of the morning.  Warren Buffett joins Becky in Omaha following the release of his annual letter to  shareholders over the weekend.  And Becky, you took a plane.  I mean, it's in the back of our minds,  is it?  It's just in the back.  There's no way.  And the risks are low.  It goes back to 1918.  It goes back to 1980.  And if you look at the numbers of what happened in that pandemic when it came around the  globe, up to 50 million people were killed in that.  It was a third of the planet's population that was infected.  It was 500 million people that were infected at that point.  Six hundred seventy five thousand Americans died at that point.  So inevitably,  your mind kind of goes back to what's happened in the past,  because as humans, we always look back to history to try and predict the future.  It doesn't always work.  It's not always prophetic,  but it does give you something  of what to kind of play out if this were to get worse and worse.  Now, Andrew brought up the idea that it's warm weather.  We're approaching spring in a lot of parts of the country,  a lot of parts of the planet  that may be good news.  We just don't know if this time around,  if this is one of those viruses that that does die off in warmer weather.  Wait and see.  Kind of hope.   Yeah, actually,  I  think this from what I've heard from people that know a lot more about viruses than I do, that that that  unfortunately, this will make it through the summer.  And and in terms of having a vaccine,  it's a long ways off.  So you've got  it is scary stuff.  I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks,  but but in terms of in terms of the human race,  it's scary stuff when you have a pandemic.  Yeah, I guess this one's particularly frightening because it's new.  So there's no natural immunity that's built up in any of the populations.  And you wonder what happens,  particularly in areas where there's not the same health care structure that we have in America or in some of the developed nations.  I guess that's a big part of the question, too.  Yeah,  it's  it's.  Well, I think about it in terms of our annual meeting.  I mean, that which is May 2nd.  I mean, it it could very well affect by that time.  It could affect.  We've got questions from viewers asking just that.  Will the annual meeting be any different this year,  particularly because you have a large  Chinese contingency of shareholders?  ->","completion":" Yeah, I don't think that certainly will be affected.  And and incidentally, I mean, flu is particularly tough on old people.  You're going to have two guys on the stage who's  combined ages one hundred eighty five. \n"}

Shares of South Korea's two largest airlines down as they canceled flights to the city of Daegu,  where many of the new cases were detected.  Meantime,  Italy's government is scrambling to deal with the biggest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of Asia.  Stocks there were lower overnight.  The government placed at least 10 towns in northern Italy under quarantine and canceled the last few days of the Venice Carnival.  Elsewhere in Italy, schools, museums, universities and cinemas were closed and major soccer matches were canceled.  At this point,  I mean, Boris Johnson out earlier today and are saying that the risk to UK citizens just over there remains low.  I would say that  our officials would say that here,  too.  The risk to the U.S.  citizens remains low.  But there's a significant difference between supply chain disruption slowing dozens and dozens and actually hundreds of companies.  Absolutely.  And that's dampening global growth.  What worries me is that we don't know three,  three months, six months, nine months, if it ever gets to the point where we start to see in a lot of  countries around the world,  these these break outs where they don't even know the origin of some of these.  And if they multiply like that,  that's when I think it could really get at this point.  It's still a it's still a global growth slowdown.  Nobody in most of the world is worried that they're going to catch coronavirus.  Right.  And they can't go out and they can't go to the movies or the health club or to a restaurant.  But that I just wonder,  we don't know.  There are major travel that's being changed right now.  Conferences are being canceled.  There was an article in Time magazine speculating when the weather the Olympics in Japan over the summer will be canceled.  So there's real implications here that could reverberate.  Having said that, the farther we get to the spring,  the better it gets in terms of weather.  There's a whole sort of it about how the flu,  you know, you know, I was looking at Jim's some of Jim's tweets earlier.  If you go too far with with the the fear and the panic,  you're accused of one thing.  If you don't go far enough,  you're accused of the other thing.  So we really just need to sit here and each day report on the facts and try to remain attached.  But there's something something about a pandemic that just is different than other black swans.  It's it's it's a frightening prospect.  Anyway, let's get right back to our guest of the morning.  Warren Buffett joins Becky in Omaha following the release of his annual letter to  shareholders over the weekend.  And Becky, you took a plane.  I mean, it's in the back of our minds,  is it?  It's just in the back.  There's no way.  And the risks are low.  It goes back to 1918.  It goes back to 1980.  And if you look at the numbers of what happened in that pandemic when it came around the  globe, up to 50 million people were killed in that.  It was a third of the planet's population that was infected.  It was 500 million people that were infected at that point.  Six hundred seventy five thousand Americans died at that point.  So inevitably,  your mind kind of goes back to what's happened in the past,  because as humans, we always look back to history to try and predict the future.  It doesn't always work.  It's not always prophetic,  but it does give you something  of what to kind of play out if this were to get worse and worse.  Now, Andrew brought up the idea that it's warm weather.  We're approaching spring in a lot of parts of the country,  a lot of parts of the planet  that may be good news.  We just don't know if this time around,  if this is one of those viruses that that does die off in warmer weather.  Wait and see.  Kind of hope.   Yeah, actually,  I  think this from what I've heard from people that know a lot more about viruses than I do, that that that  unfortunately, this will make it through the summer.  And and in terms of having a vaccine,  it's a long ways off.  So you've got  it is scary stuff.  I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks,  but but in terms of in terms of the human race,  it's scary stuff when you have a pandemic.  Yeah, I guess this one's particularly frightening because it's new.  So there's no natural immunity that's built up in any of the populations.  And you wonder what happens,  particularly in areas where there's not the same health care structure that we have in America or in some of the developed nations.  I guess that's a big part of the question, too.  Yeah,  it's  it's.  Well, I think about it in terms of our annual meeting.  I mean, that which is May 2nd.  I mean, it it could very well affect by that time.  It could affect.  We've got questions from viewers asking just that.  Will the annual meeting be any different this year,  particularly because you have a large  Chinese contingency of shareholders?   Yeah, I don't think that certainly will be affected.  And and incidentally, I mean, flu is particularly tough on old people.  You're going to have two guys on the stage who's  combined ages one hundred eighty five.   So,  yeah, well, we won't be looking for people showing any signs of contagion.  But that's one of the problems with this is it does have a long gestation period and it's highly transmissible. And again, you did talk about it earlier.  It's something that you see in the results of the businesses,  even some of your own fully owned businesses that you didn't anticipate. ->","completion":" Well, we own airlines, for example.

Let's talk a little bit about Berkshire Hathaway.  We were in the middle of a conversation when we had to go to a break before.

And I will tell you that that  if you were to say and let's say the stock market didn't change for two years and interest rates didn't change.  So you had a two year period and you said we'll sell off all the businesses.  I don't think  I mean, you have the expenses of selling them now.  If you sold them all to people who leveraged them up to their maximum,  you might get a little more than the stock is selling for.  It would be very tax inefficient,  very tax inefficient.  Interestingly enough,  up till 1986,  it wouldn't have been.  I mean, there was a general utilities doctrine that governed corporate breakups.  And so you could dispose of  businesses or securities.  If you did it right,  you could dispose of securities or businesses that are appreciated  without a tax at the corporate level.  That was done regularly in various ways up till 1986.  They revised the tax code big time.  They killed general utilities.  You can't do that now.  Now you can go you can have spinoffs,  this business or that business.  You probably have to lie a little in terms of your purpose in order to  get the best tax ruling.  And it takes time.  But you cannot break up.  You cannot dispose of the entire business,  business by business,  without having very substantial tax liability.  It would not produce a gain.  On the other hand,  having them together produces there's some very valuable synergies in there.  Now, we don't use leverage as much as the people who would buy them piece by piece would do.  So we could leverage  Berkshire up to the sky.  I promise people we won't because we have insurance promises to people out 50 or 100 years and we've got shareholders are going to own the stock for 50 years and they do not want us to  to leverage to the sky. \n"}

And therefore, you have to explain those policies and you have to live up to those policies.  And for 55 years,  we've tried to. \n"}
{"prompt":" But  there would not be a profit if if  we were simply to announce that over the next 24 months that you could come in and buy any business we had and we'd sell them to the highest bidder.  You made a point of talking about this in the annual letter.  You said key to my only Berkshire key to my Berkshire only institutions is my faith in the future judgment of fidelity of Berkshire directors.  They will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees and many companies.  These super salesmen might win.  I do not,  however, expect this to happen.   That's exactly true.  And I think by writing it,  it helps a little too.  No, there's no question that that Wall Street would love to come along and sell anything that we've got.  I mean, there's a fee every time that there's a transaction and they're big fees and there's fees for financing.  I mean, there's so we've had all kinds of  people snoop around that they know they're not getting done with me,  but they won't get done later on either.  I am leaving every every share of Berkshire goes to charity and it's ninety nine percent of my net worth.  So I got  nobody cares more than I do about getting the most money to those philanthropies over the four of the years following my death.  And that's going to take place over 15 years.  And I say keep it all in Berkshire.  But if I thought that it was going to be run in a way responsive to  Wall Street, I would I would instead do something else and have the money distributed to these philanthropies and not have it all tied to Berkshire.  But Berkshire has a very unusual shareholder base.  I mean, we have individuals that own Berkshire and a lot of them have owned it 50 years.  Just like it's people buy it to own for a lifetime.  And and we're going to run it in a way that they won't be disappointed.   Do you think the people who are newer,  relatively newer shareholders buying the B shares have the same mentality as the people who have been in it for 50 years?   Well, we try to because that's who we encourage.  I mean, in effect,  we don't want everybody to buy our stock.  I mean, there's only so many seats.  There's about a million six hundred and some thousand a shares out.  All the seats are filled.  I love the shareholders we have.  I don't want to go to Wall Street and try and get some new shareholders  to replace the people we have.  So what we want to have is people in those seats that are in sync with us.  You can run a French restaurant or you can run a hamburger stand.  And if you serve good hamburgers,  you'll do good business.  They have a standing at the French restaurant.  You do the same thing there.  But you can't run the French restaurant and serve hamburgers inside.  And you can't run the hamburger stand and serve French food inside.  So we advertise in our deeds,  in our words and every way we can what we're about.  And we're looking to have the seats filled at our church  by people who are in sync with us.  And we do have them there.  We get the same people every Sunday.  And I see no advantage in going out and telling everybody in Wall Street we're going to do wonderful things and having those seats replaced,  because the only way you can get a seat is to throw somebody else out of that seat.  There's only so many seats and they're all full.  And you want them filled with people who are in sync  with the with the policies of the company.  And therefore, you have to explain those policies and you have to live up to those policies.  And for 55 years,  we've tried to.   So you get the shareholders you deserve.  Exactly.  All right.  Not to mix metaphors,  but can you have a decentralized central office running both the French restaurant and the hamburger place?  Well,  they aren't trying.  We're not trying to have the railroad management run the utility.  You're decentralized.  That's what I mean.  A decentralized headquarters that's in charge,  a conglomerate in charge of all those different businesses.  ->","completion":" Well, we could run.  Well, we have decentralized management as it is.  We could have somebody in charge of all the little companies,  another one for the big.  I mean, we could visualize it in all kinds of ways.  I think we'd have more overhead.  I think we'd have a different sort of manager.  Our managers like running their own businesses and they they like  they never have to finance their businesses.  I mean, they never have to go to Wall Street.  They never they probably save 25 percent of their time.  And and I want them to feel they own their businesses.  And that's all they're responsible for.  If we mess up some other way, you know,  they still they get paid based on how they do.  And and there again,  we attract managers who like to operate on that basis.  We don't attract managers,  particularly who think they're going to keep moving step by step  through various divisions and eventually run the whole place. \n"}

One of the things that people wrote in,  a lot of people had questions about the banks,  about what's happening with the banks,  what you've changed with some of your investments over time.  Jason Goldberg writes in,  he says, please ask more about his views on the bank stocks in general and on Wells Fargo in particular.  Over the last two quarters,  he sold almost a quarter of his longstanding Wells Fargo stake.  Also in the fourth quarter,  he dumped a third of his Goldman stock Goldman Sachs shares,  although he still owns over seventy five billion dollars in bank equities.  So what do you think about banks?  Not necessarily the sell off today because you don't look at day by day.  Well,  banking is a good business if you don't do dumb things on the asset side. ->","completion":" I mean, basically,  and it's a business that the banks we own earn between  the commercial banks earn between 12 percent  and 16 percent or so on  tangible assets.  That's a good business.  It's a fantastic business against  the long term bond.  You know, a two percent.  If you have a choice between a two percent instrument and a 12 percent instrument,  which one is going to win over time?  So,  so if you ask me whether I think banks are going to go down where they only earn three or four percent on tangible assets,  I don't think that'll happen.  The question is really whether they do something massively dumb.  I mean, which periodically a number of banks have done.  And I feel very good about the banks we own.  They're  they're very attractive compared to most other securities I see.  And and most of them are buying Bank of America is buying in a lot of stock every year.  So our ownership of the Bank of America this year probably will go up seven or eight percent without a spending a dime.  I'd like to own any business,  any good business where my ownership is up seven or eight percent every year without me spending any money.  And on top of it, I get a dividend.

He says an ounce of perversion,  an ounce of prevention is not worth a pound of cure.  An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.  And we've seen that time after time. And the interesting thing I and I don't know the details at all, but  the original thing was a bunch of a whole bunch of phony accounts.  Now, I don't know how if you open up a couple of million phony accounts,  you make any money on it at all.  I mean, I don't the shareholders didn't make money.  People say that, well, the incentive structure was set up so that some of the employees  don't have a system.  You can think and as soon as you learn,  you can devise dumb incentive systems.  We've done ourselves.  I mean, you can you can cause people to do the wrong thing because they will do what they're incented to do.  And they had obviously a very dumb incentive system.

You know, but the you absolutely have to attack a problem  as soon as it occurs.  And you know about it. And if that had happened,  Wells Fargo shareholders would be a lot better off.  But Wells Fargo shareholders did not did not profit from opening up accounts that were phony accounts that had nothing in them.  I mean, somebody was getting paid so much per account.  So and the practice spread because bad practices do spread if they're allowed to spread.  And they were ignored, which is  a total disaster.  And and look at the consequences.

But OK,  I want to ask you a question about Todd Combs and his new role at Geico.  I got several questions that came in from that.  And let's just use this one from Peter Lampras.  During last year's interview on CNBC,  after the 2018 letter was released,  you were asked about succession at Geico.  And you mentioned that at a recent meeting at Geico,  you met about 40 of their top executives.  And after each introduced themselves,  they stated their length of time with the company.  The shortest was 19 years.  Please explain why none of these 40 top executives were qualified to take over as CEO after the retirement of Bill Roberts.  Again, that's Pete Lampras from Chicago.   Bill Roberts took over.  Not even two years ago and last and he has done a terrific job in connection with Tony.  And I mean,  Geico is my first love.  Absolutely.  I tell the other companies that you can't compete for my second love,  but you can't compete for my first love,  which is Geico, because it goes back 60,  69 years.  And it did wonderful.  Anyway,  Geico,  Bill Roberts took over a little less than two years ago.  And then in either October or November last year,  he said he would he'd like to retire in a year.  He would  adjust it in any way that  made it the easiest for us.  And and we did not have the person,  in my view,  to replace him at that point.  And Todd Combs,  who's worked with Berkshire now for 10 years,  he actually was a product manager at Progressive in the past.  And he knows a lot about insurance.  Insurance is probably the only business I know something about that we're in.  All the rest of them are full of confusion.  But I understand the insurance business to some degree.  Todd understands it very well at the operating level.  And so Todd is there.  And I hope very much that that he's not there very long because I'd like to get him back to Omaha.  But our intention always is to promote from within.  And we would hope to pick out the right person at Geico.  It isn't that there isn't somebody there.  It's just you want to have the right one,  because when you put somebody in,  you're going to keep them there for a long time.  And or her.  And does that suggest Todd is not going to be there for a long time? ->","completion":" I don't think he's going to know.  No, the plan is not for him to be.

They were buying stock at the same time we were buying stock.  But it was easier for us to buy Apple stock,  even though Apple itself was buying a lot of stock than it is to buy Berkshire.  Berkshire is,  well, it's held by people that really plan to keep it.  There's I think the amount of speculation in Berkshire stock is relatively low compared to most stocks.  And so it's it's it's it's  well, we bought five billion dollars worth last year,  but that's only one percent of the market cap.

{"prompt":" You know, one of the things you talked about in the annual letter was  stock buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway.  Right.  And for the first time you told people to call Mark Millard in your office  outright if they have 20 million dollars worth of Berkshire shares and they're ready to sell.  Right.  That's a really unusual move.  Why did you do that?   Well, we did it because  it's very hard to buy blocks  in the market of Berkshire.  We probably never see blocks except we do see them from  estates or occasionally.  But if somebody is going to sell 100 million shares,  100 million dollars worth of Berkshire and we want to buy it,  we'd like them to call us.

You know, the 10 year speaking of these low rates just a little bit ago hit its lowest yield since July of 2016.  This morning, I think it was one point three,  seven, seven percent.  We're back at one point three,  nine, six percent, but 10 year rates below one point four percent.  You have anticipated this.  It makes no sense to lend money at one point four percent to the U.S.  government when it's government policy to change,  to have two percent a year inflation.  I mean, you've got you've got  the government is telling you we're going to give you one point four percent and tax you on it.  And on the other hand, we're going to  presumably devalue that money at two percent a year.  So these are very unusual conditions. And classical economics, it doesn't appear that,  you know, what do people do under such circumstances?  Everybody buy a mattress and stick their money under the mattress or what?  And it particularly seems  unusual when the world is generally prosperous.  And, you know, but that's the game is always changing,  but it always looks logical in retrospect.  And it always looks puzzling and prospectively.  But there's always things to do that make sense to like what?  Well, I hope that's what we're doing.  It's buying good businesses at decent prices,  whether all of the businesses or parts of the businesses through the stock market.  You know, you told me a year and a half ago,  maybe longer, that when you went out to try and buy whole businesses right now,  it just looks too expensive.  Which is why you started buying pieces of companies,  more stocks, but places like Apple.  Is that still the case?  Is it still a huge premium to try and buy a company outright?  ->","completion":" There's quite a premium.  And part of the premium is because you can borrow so much money so cheap,  so cheaply in buying those businesses.  Obviously, you can pay more for a business if you can borrow a very high percentage of  the purchase price and of the future cash flow committed to it.  And you can borrow low rates with with very little in the way of restrictions,  restrictive covenants or anything of the sort.  I mean, that's going to bring higher prices.  And the demand for that is huge.  And people look at those rates on the 30 year,  the 10 year, and they say to themselves,  gee, I can't live on that.  And so they they stretch and buy poor credits.  But that's that's just part of the human cycle over time.  And that that leads to something else.  And that leads to something else.

{"prompt":" What's something you guys don't understand right now?  Oh, we we do not understand at all  what the outcome will be  in a world where 13 trillion is being borrowed at less than zero.  And even Greece went on short term.  And I think Greece,  the 10 year bond is one percent, for example.

I hear you have a question to Andrew.  I have I actually have a couple.  And I thought that I read the letter like everybody else over the weekend.  It was fascinated by so many of your comments.  Warren, specifically, I wanted to ask you,  you talk about diversity on boards in this letter.  And one of the things I wanted you to weigh in on,  if you could, is I don't know if you saw,  but David Salomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,  on our air, actually announced a couple of weeks ago that he won't be taking any companies public.  Goldman won't unless they have at least one diverse board member and are likely going to push that to two.  You know, in the state of California,  they put a law into place saying that you needed to have a female board member.  And I'm curious what you think of not just the push towards more diversity on boards, but the requirement.  Because I also note in your letter that you have very specific thoughts about what it means to be a board member,  what it means to be an independent board member, how wealth  is involved in all of that.  What are your thoughts?  Well,  at Berkshire for decades,  we've given the three factors in addition to integrity,  but for board membership.  And we want people who are business savvy.  We want them to have a  strong personal interest in Berkshire itself.  And we've got directors who really represent shareholders,  basically, at Berkshire.  And I think they do a great job.  Now, that doesn't mean that they don't think that we should delight our customers,  that we should treat associates well,  that we should behave well in our community,  both local and national.  But  our directors represent the shareholders.  So  Warren, just to just to follow up on it, though,  what's your thought about both the requirement that maybe banks and others,  investors are going to force companies to have diverse candidates on their board laws,  as I mentioned, in California?  Yeah,  I actually there there may be there's been sent to us a proposal,  which unless it's withdrawn,  will be on our proxy.  I can't tell you precisely what it says,  but the relationship issue and we will get our shareholders view on it.  But I,  I personally and I want shareholders that I want directors that represent the shareholders.  And, you know,  in terms of my estate,  you know, with with  maybe currently 80 billion dollars worth of shares to give to philanthropy,  I hope that we have  a and we do have a group of directors that I think will be very conscious of doing the right thing.  The reason I ask the question is because the other point you made,  which I think is a very smart one and is often misconstrued in the corporate governance land,  is that an independent director these days isn't always independent in large part.  And you make the point that those that don't come to the table with some form of wealth often need the job.  They need the money.  They want the money.  And therefore, that makes them less independent.  And the reason I ask this is one of the things as we've been trying to get more diverse candidates on boards,  more women on boards,  as you know, there are there are there are fewer CEOs,  fewer people who have made enormous amounts of money and people therefore they can question their independence.  It becomes a very tricky issue.  And that's what I was hoping you might weigh in on.  ->","completion":" Yeah, Andrew, I've been on 21 publicly owned boards of publicly owned companies and I've seen them in operation.  And I would say that  that people that I have often seen and that's perfectly understandable.  I have often seen people who are classified as independent directors and they are getting three hundred thousand dollars a year for a job that takes them  a couple of days,  maybe six times a year,  maybe four times a year.  And the company flies into their office and it's very enjoyable and the company's good.  And and who wouldn't want a job like that?  I mean, it's an incredible job.  And people I get calls from I get calls from headhunters.  I get calls from CEOs and they ask,  you know, who I think would make a quote good and quote director.  And what they are asking is,  you know, who is not going to cause too much trouble and who is going to reflect who their name is going to reflect credit on the institution.  And they are not looking for somebody that that that I would regard as really independent.  And I don't blame them.  I mean, if if if I had spent my life being,  you know, a teacher or whatever it might be,  I mean, my IQ is just as high as the average or higher than the people on the boards.  And all that.  But on the other hand,  I want to get on a board.  I mean, three hundred thousand bucks a year would look terrific.  And you don't even have to retire.  Probably in most cases,  a sixty five or anything of the sort.  So to call them independent is ridiculous.  And if you're if you're on one board like that,  you want to really go on another one and make six hundred thousand a year.  And you are not going to do things that irritate your president,  CEO.  So when he or she gets a call and says,  would this guy make a good director,  that the answer is no.  It's it's it's just ridiculous to ignore the factor of compensation with board members. \n"}

I have often seen people who are classified as independent directors and they are getting three hundred thousand dollars a year for a job that takes them  a couple of days,  maybe six times a year,  maybe four times a year.  And the company flies into their office and it's very enjoyable and the company's good.  And and who wouldn't want a job like that?  I mean, it's an incredible job.  And people I get calls from I get calls from headhunters.  I get calls from CEOs and they ask,  you know, who I think would make a quote good and quote director.  And what they are asking is,  you know, who is not going to cause too much trouble and who is going to reflect who their name is going to reflect credit on the institution.  And they are not looking for somebody that that that I would regard as really independent.  And I don't blame them.  I mean, if if if I had spent my life being,  you know, a teacher or whatever it might be,  I mean, my IQ is just as high as the average or higher than the people on the boards.  And all that.  But on the other hand,  I want to get on a board.  I mean, three hundred thousand bucks a year would look terrific.  And you don't even have to retire.  Probably in most cases,  a sixty five or anything of the sort.  So to call them independent is ridiculous.  And if you're if you're on one board like that,  you want to really go on another one and make six hundred thousand a year.  And you are not going to do things that irritate your president,  CEO.  So when he or she gets a call and says,  would this guy make a good director,  that the answer is no.  It's it's it's just ridiculous to ignore the factor of compensation with board members.   OK,  all right, let me let me ask a follow up question that is similarly related.  Warren, and that's just having to do with sustainability,  all these issues that are out there,  guys in the control room.  Sorry, this is not where I told you I was going.  But Abhishek Bhojra wrote in a question.  He said Larry Fink recently said that our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate integrated portfolios can provide better risk adjusted return to investors.  What's your view on sustainable investing?   Well, I don't happen to make that decision when I'm  buying stocks in our portfolio.  I'm I what their individual policies are.  I think they're all pro social.  I mean, obviously,  you've got to be in tune with your society.  But if you if you think that I look down at a bunch of stocks and decide whether to buy Apple or whether to buy J.P.  Morgan or I am not I'm not using the the factors and and the delays out.   OK,  I want to run through a series of questions that have been in.  These are kind of all over the map.  So forgive me, we'll bounce around.  But these are questions that came in from viewers that I thought were good ones.  Lucas writes in, he said, did Justin Sun change your mind on cryptocurrency?  For anybody who doesn't know,  Justin Sun bought the dinner or the lunch that you just had from the last Glide Foundation fundraiser.  He is actively involved in Bitcoin.  After that meeting,  his PR people put out some notes saying that, you know,  you kind of listen to cryptocurrency and maybe you're a little more in tune with the idea of Bitcoin now.   Well, I would say this when Justin and four friends came,  they behaved perfectly and we had a good three and a half hour dinner.  And the whole thing was a very friendly exchange of ideas.  But cryptocurrency is basically have no value and they don't produce anything.  So you can look at your little ledger item for the next 20  years and it says you've got X of this cryptocurrency or that it doesn't reproduce.  It doesn't it doesn't deliver.  It can't mail you a check.  It can't do anything.  And what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for it later on.  But then that person's got the problem.  But in terms of value,  you know, zero.  So it sounds like he did not change your position.  ->","completion":" No, but I didn't change his either.  And I had a very pleasant dinner.  And those people were,  they behaved more than well.  And they gave four point six or Justin gave four point six million to Glide.  And that will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco.  So I thank him. \n"}

And this person writes in private labels have performed very well against brands like Kraft Heinz,  but they haven't made a dent against other brands like Coca-Cola or C's.

Do what other people spent a hundred years,  you know, with huge amounts of advertising and special display,  all kinds of things.  So the battle goes on.  I would say that the retailer has gained ground against brands to some degree.  But brands are still terribly important.

Warren, one of the questions that did come in,  it was something that you wrote about in the annual letter,  was the role that Greg and Ajit play.  Greg Abel, Ajit Jain, the two vice chairman who were recently added as vice chairman,  the role that they're going to be playing in the annual meeting with shareholders.

I mean, try and give me a 10 billion dollar budget and ask me to bring out another Coca-Cola that makes a dent in Coca-Cola.  And I can't do it.   Warren, one of the questions that did come in,  it was something that you wrote about in the annual letter,  was the role that Greg and Ajit play.  Greg Abel, Ajit Jain, the two vice chairman who were recently added as vice chairman,  the role that they're going to be playing in the annual meeting with shareholders.  You said that they will play a larger role in the shareholder meeting.  How will that work?   Well, it will mean that any shareholder or any of the journalists there who are presenting questions from shareholders that have been sent to them can direct those questions to either Ajit or to Greg.  So if they were insurance questions,  they might want to direct them to Ajit,  not insurance questions to Greg.  But they will be there  and we'll have 60 or so questions.  We don't know what they're going to be.  And if anybody says,  I would like Greg to answer this or I would like Ajit to answer this,  then they're right there adjacent to us.   They'll be sitting on stage with you and Charlie?  ->","completion":" Well, there's this.  Yeah, there's there's somebody sitting in front of the crowd.  There's two different levels of tears there.  Yeah. \n"}

OK, let's go on to a question that is posed by Ken Ducey.  He says you sold 31 newspapers after buying them over 40 years as a self-described newspaper addict.  You said recently that most newspapers were toast.  I know that's not exactly that's not true.  This isn't his question.  You can answer that.  Yeah.

He was interviewing me and I repeated it.  But the the problem is even every day,  the circulation of the papers in every every print circulation goes down.  And the interesting thing about it,  of course, is that the three survivors so far that look promising online are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.  All three of those papers  sold their smaller papers.  The New York Times sold,  I think, 11 papers  about seven or eight years ago.  The Dow Jones, which owned The Wall Street Journal and now is owned by News Corp,  they sold the Ottawa newspapers, eight papers.  Washington Post sold the Epoch Tarot.  So they all saw the handwriting on the wall before I did.  And they all sold their papers.  That was their reaction.  They did not they did not try and figure out the online solutions.  They got out of them.  And unfortunately, I bought some and we're still in.  I mean, we are financing Lee and we think Lee has by far the best opportunity  to continue print as long as anybody and to find an online solution for these papers.  So we put new money into the newspaper industry here or we've committed to do it. \n"}

The businesses have left the incredible period,  which is about as extraordinary as I've seen in business since World War II,  where the government would port out a lot of money to people who couldn't get goods.  It was more extreme in World War II,  but this was extreme this time. And it was just a question of getting goods to deliver, and people bought, and they didn't wait for sales.

And we don't pay much attention to markets or forecasts unless the markets  happen to offer something interesting to do.  But  nevertheless, we are positioned in two respects, as you'll see from this first report.  Our investment income is going to be a lot larger this year than last year,  and that's built in.  I  mean,  we had, as you'll see in a minute,  we've had $125 billion or so in very short-term investments,  and believe it or not, not that long ago,  we were getting four basis points,  which is next to nothing, on that $125 billion, which means we were getting $50 million a year,  and now the same money the other,  just day or day before yesterday, we actually bought, because of some funny twist in the market because of doubts about the deficit ceiling,  or the debt ceiling,  we bought $3 billion of bills at a 590,  that's 5.9,  5.92,  bond equivalent yield.  So we will have  what produced us not that long ago on a 12-month basis was producing $50 million a year,  producing something in the area of $5 billion a year.  So we're in a position where the investment income is essentially,  well, it is certain to increase quite a bit.  And insurance underwriting is not,  it does not correlate with business activity.  It depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes and  other events.  So on a perspective basis, on a probability basis, we're likely to have a better year this year in insurance underwriting than we had last year.  It just isn't affected by what you might call the business cycle,  or what applies to generally an industry,  pee-tailing, you name it.  So I would expect,  in one massive earthquake or one hurricane that came in at just the wrong place,  can affect that prediction.  But on a probabilistic basis,  our insurance looks better this year.  ->","completion":" So if you get two of the elements there of our earnings that  look like they will swing in our direction, I would expect, but I can't promise that our operating earnings will be greater than last year.  And if we'll move to the second slide,  I give you those operating earnings figures just to give you  an overview of what has happened since the pandemic started and often the year before as a base.  And we retain all our earnings, as you know.  So if we're retaining $30 or $35 billion or whatever it may be a year, you should expect more operating earnings over time.  I mean,  this number should be significantly higher five or ten or 15 years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings. And that's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started. And they got there by retaining earnings and will keep retaining earnings.  So it's no great triumph if these numbers move up.  And what we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate.\n"}

So if you get two of the elements there of our earnings that  look like they will swing in our direction, I would expect, but I can't promise that our operating earnings will be greater than last year.  And if we'll move to the second slide,  I give you those operating earnings figures just to give you  an overview of what has happened since the pandemic started and often the year before as a base.  And we retain all our earnings, as you know.  So if we're retaining $30 or $35 billion or whatever it may be a year, you should expect more operating earnings over time.  I mean,  this number should be significantly higher five or ten or 15 years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings. And that's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started. And they got there by retaining earnings and will keep retaining earnings.  So it's no great triumph if these numbers move up.  And what we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate.  Historically,  they moved up at an unreasonable rate sometimes, but we were working with much smaller sums then. And that can't be repeated with our present capital base.  Because I note there,  I believe it's on this slide.   Let's take a look.   Now that'll be,  let's see, it's on the next page.  Let's move to the next slide.

Now what might surprise you is that there's no other company in the United States,  no other company that has a number that is that large. ->","completion":" Now,  that isn't because we've got the most valuable company in the United States.  Other companies have used their money to repurchase shares.  They could have accumulated $504 billion in gap.  But basically we have more  under gap accounting now than any other company in the US.  And of course, if you measure return on equity,  that becomes a very big number to increase at a rapid rate, but we hope to do so.  Not a rapid rate,  a decent rate. And right below that,  you see something called float.  And float is money that  is left in our hands somewhat akin,  but very importantly different than a bank deposit.  But you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit,  you have to pay more interest these days, and you have to run a bank and do a lot of things.  And basically,  this is money that represents unpaid losses at this time.\n"}

And that float, if you think about it,  just think of a balance sheet.  You've got liabilities here,  and you've got assets over here. And the liability side finances the asset side.  It's very simple.  And stockholders' equity finances it,  long-term debt finances it, and so on.  But stockholders' equity is very expensive in a real sense.  Long-term debt has been cheap for a while,  but it can get expensive, and it can also become due eventually,  and it may not be available.

So I show at the bottom what's happened with cash and Treasury bills through March 31st.  And I will tell you that in the month of April, we probably added about $7 billion to that factor.  Now, part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock,  because that reduces cash and Treasury bills.  We bought about $400 million worth of stock in the month of April.  That's a minus in terms of cash available.  And we, however, sold some stock which produced maybe $4 billion. And of course, we had operating earnings, probably $2.5 billion or something in that area. And my guess is we probably increased our cash and Treasury bills $6 and $7 billion in the month.

{"prompt":" Yeah, we didn't go crazy.   OK,  Becky.   This question comes from Ben Noll in Minneapolis.  He says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades and he's attended many Berkshire meetings.  He's here again this year.  And this is addressed to Ajit and Greg.  He says last year I asked you about how GEICO and BNSF appeared to lose ground to their leading competitors,  GEICO on telematics and BNSF on precision scheduled railroading.  Ajit, you responded by saying how you expected GEICO to make progress in a year or two.  Greg, you spoke about your pride in BNSF,  but you didn't directly address the threat of precision scheduled railroading.  Will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges and our company's strategies to address them?   In  terms of GEICO and telematics,  let me make the observation that GEICO has certainly taken the bull by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap in terms of telematics and its competitors.  They have now reached a point where on all new business,  close to 90% has a telematics  input to the pricing decision.   Unfortunately,  less than half of that is being taken up by the policyholders.  The other point I want to make is even though we have made improvements  in terms of bridging the gap on telematics,  we still haven't started to realize the true benefit  and the real culprit or the bottleneck is technology.  GEICO's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did.  It has more than 500,  actually more than 600 legacy systems that don't really talk to each other  and we are trying to compress them to no more than 15,  16 systems that all talk to each other.  That's a monumental challenge and because  of that, even though we have made improvements in telematics,  we still have a long way to go  because of technology.  Because of that and because of the whole issue more  broadly in terms of matching rate to risk,  GEICO is still a work in progress.  I don't know if any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results,  but GEICO has had  a very good first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change,  which means a margin  of six and change.  Even though that's very good,  it's not something we can take to the bank  because there are two unusual items that contributed to it.  Firstly,  we've had what is called prior year reserve releases.  We've reduced reserves for the previous years and  that contributed to it.  And secondly, every year, the first quarter tends to be a seasonally  good quarter for auto insurance  writers.  So if you adjust those two factors,  my guess is the end of the year,  GEICO will end up  with a combined ratio just south of 100 as opposed to the target they're shooting for is 96.  I hope they reach the target of 96 by the end of next year, but instead of getting too excited about it,  I think it's important to realize that even if we reach 96,  it will come at the expense of having lost policy holders.  There is a tradeoff between profitability and growth and clearly,  we're going to emphasize  profitability and not growth and that will come at the expense of policy holders.  So it will not be until two years from now that we'll be back on track  fighting the battles on both the profitability and growth front.  Garden?  Yep.   Moving to BNSF.  I'll start again by expressing great pride in the BNSF team.  We have an exceptional group of led by Katie and her managers that show up every day to do great work on the railroad.  At the same time,  they would be the first to acknowledge there's more to be done there.  The specific reference to precision scheduled railroading.  The other large railroad,  Class A railroads in the U.S.  follow that and including the two in Canada.  We're well aware of what they're doing and obviously pay close attention to their operating metrics.  Our team strives every day to be more efficient, obviously.  I would say we balance it with the needs of our customers.  If I look back to pre-2022,  so we look at the three-year period of 2019,  2020,  2021,  the BNSF team made significant progress on their efficiencies and delivering overall value back to the shareholders and to their customers.  And at the same time,  maintaining a very safe railroad for our employees.  So we're making excellent progress.  That didn't stop last year.  They made great progress again.  The reality in 2022 is we did go through a period of time where we had to  call it reset the railroad.  We came out of the pandemic.  There were the supply challenges.  We had certain other labor issues and other things going on at the port.  And the reality is our team prioritized getting the railroad back in place for the long term,  not a short-term focus on hitting certain operating metrics.  And in 2022, we're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics.  But the real focus was to get the railroad reset in a safe manner such that we could deliver long-term value and long-term service  to our customers.  And that's really what we'll continue to see with that team.  There'll be continual progress.  There'll be years where it's not as quickly or even we go backwards.  But over the long term,  we'll see exceptional results from that team and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset.  Thank you.  I would  just –  well, he deserves – both of them deserve applause.  I would like to add one thing.  The –  at GEICO, Todd Combs was the chief choice, my choice,  go back to GEICO to work on the problem of matching rate to risk, which is what insurance is all about.

They've eaten up capital.   But there's been one company that nobody  has generally heard of.

We took on the whole industry, and we brought some unique talent, and the four people that came and now have, like I said, 1,500 or so worldwide.  And we brought capital, and we brought capabilities that really only Berkshire could supply.  So it was the combination of  brains and talent and energy and money.  And  no one has really successfully entered this space, only people in this space,  who didn't like us coming. And we did it without it.\n"}
{"prompt":" I'm glad you got that in.  Your priorities are right.   Yes, I have a question on AI and robotics.  Here's my question.  As AI and robotics continue to advance,  what do you believe will be the positive and the negative impact  of this technology on both the stocks market and society as a whole?  And are there any specific industrials and companies  that you believe will be most impacted?   Karen, I thank you for asking Charlie that question.  Well,  if you went into BYD's factories in China,  you would see robotics going in at an unbelievable rate.  So we're going to see a lot more robotics in the world.  I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence.  I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.  There won't be anything in AI that replaces Ajeet.   I'll  state that unqualifiedly.  It can do amazing things.  Bill Gates brought me out the latest,  maybe not the latest version, but one he thought maybe I could handle,  which has to be careful with me in terms of leading me too fast.  And it did these remarkable things. ->","completion":" It didn't, but it couldn't tell jokes.   Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me.  And it just isn't there.\n"}

But,  you know, things like  checking all the legal opinions, you know,  since the beginning of time and everything,  and eliminating all the side...  I mean, it can do all kinds of things.  And when something can do all kinds of things,  I get a little bit worried.  And because I know we won't be able to uninvent it.  And, you know,  we did invent for very, very good reason, the atom bomb  in World War II.  And it was,  you know, it was enormously important that we did so.  But  is it good for the next 200 years of the world that  the ability to do so has been unleashed?  We didn't have any choice.  ->","completion":" But when  you start something...

{"prompt":" The owners do.   Well,  but most people like to buy with non-recourse in real estate.  And one time I asked Charlie,  there was some real estate guy we were talking to,  and how do they decide how much a building like this is worth?  And the answer is, it's whatever they can borrow without signing their name. And if you look at real estate generally, you'll understand what the phenomenon that's happening if you remind yourself that that's  the attitude of most people that have become big in the real estate business. And it does mean that the lenders are the ones that get the property.  And of course, they don't want the property usually.  So then the real estate operator comes on negotiating with them and  the banks tend to  extend and pretend. And there's all kinds of activities that arrive out of commercial real estate development, which occurs on a big scale.  But it all has consequences.  And I think we're about, well, we are starting to see the consequences of people who could borrow at  2.5% and  find out it doesn't work at current rates.  And they hand it back to somebody that gave them all the money they needed to build it.  Charlie's had more experience in real estate.  Charlie got it started in real estate,  though.   I mean, Charlie.  Yes,  it's difficult.  I like what we do better.  Well,  Charlie once said to me when I was leaving his house a  few months ago, I was visiting him.  We talked for a couple of hours.  And I said to Charlie as I left, I just  wasn't anybody else in the house, except  one daughter. And I said, Charlie, I'll just keep  doing what we've been doing. And Charlie said,  without looking up or pausing a second,  he said, that's all you know how to do, Warren.  Yeah.  He was right, too.  Station three, is it?  Hi, my name is Dallas Z.  I'm from Santa Clara,  California.  And my question is to Charlie and Warren.  Given the rise of disruptive technologies that can improve productivity significantly,  and AI being one of them,  how do you envision the future of value investing in this new era?  And what adaptations or new principles do you think investors should adopt?  And any recommendations for investors to remain successful in this rapid changing landscape?  Thank you.  Well, I'm glad to take that one.  I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so  many of them competing for  a diminished bunch of opportunities.  So my advice to value investors is to get used to making less.  And Charlie has been telling me the same thing the whole time we've known each other.  We get along wonderfully because we are making less.  Yeah, well, but that's because that mostly I think is because it's larger.  We never thought we could manage 508 billion.  No.  Or one or five.  But I would argue that there's going to be plenty of opportunities. And part of the reason there are going to be plenty of opportunities, the tech doesn't make any difference or any of that.  I mean, if you look at how the world's changed in the years  since 1942 when I started, you'd say, well,  how does a kid that doesn't know anything about airplanes,  that doesn't know anything about engines and cars, and doesn't know anything about electricity and all that. ->","completion":" But  that really isn't the,  that's not the, the world changing doesn't,  or new things coming along don't take away the opportunities.  What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. And I would say that while the 58 years we've been running Berkshire,  I would say there's been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things and they do big dumb things.  And the reason they do it to some extent is because they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started.  So you could start  10 or 15 dumb insurance companies in the last 10 years and you could become rich.\n"}
{"prompt":" If you were a droid at it,  whether the business succeeded or not,  and the underwriters got paid and the lawyers got paid. And that creates, if that's done on a large scale, which it couldn't be done, what, 58 years ago, you couldn't get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do, fortunately. And so I think that investing has disappeared so  much from this huge capitalistic market that anybody can play in,  but that the big money is in selling other people ideas.  It isn't outperforming,  in outperforming.  And I think that, I think if you don't run too much money, which we do, but if you're running small amounts of money, I think, I think the opportunities will be greater.  But then Charlie and I were always different on this subject.   He likes to tell me how gloomy the world is.  And I like to tell him, we'll find something.  And so far, we've both been kind of right.  Charlie, would you  budge an inch on that or not? There is so much money now in the hands of  so many smart people,  all trying to outsmart one another and outpromote one another,  getting more money out of other people.  And it's a  radically different world from the world we started in. And  I suppose it will have its opportunities, but  it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes.   But they're trying to outsmart each other in arenas  that you don't have to play.  I mean,  if you look at that government bond market, the Treasury bill market, I mean, you've got this one bill that's out of line with the others.  We went over $3 billion of it the other day.  And,  but those are people, the world is overwhelmingly short term focused. And if you go to an investor relations call,  they're all trying to figure out  how to fill out a sheet to show the earnings for the year.  And the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten. ->","completion":" I mean,  that  is a world that's made to order for  anybody that's trying to think about what you do that should work over five or 10 or 20 years.  And I just think that I would love to be born today and go out with not too much money and hopefully turn it into a lot of money.\n"}
{"prompt":" A few weeks ago,  you talked about the risks of banks with assets that were susceptible to rising interest rates.  Any insight as to how Berkshire liabilities are susceptible to duration would be appreciated.  Is that directed to Ajit or me or what?  Both.   Okay, let me introduce one thing, and well,  but Ajit is the key to this.  He's the one that put the deal together.   But we got handed $10 billion,  we'll say.   But we weren't restricted to putting that into bonds.  ->","completion":" So what the exact  interest rates affect us to some degree,  maybe, in terms of the deal we did with AIG or  anybody we would do a similar deal with like that.  But we don't have to put it in matching bonds or anything of the sort.  It goes into a general pool of assets, which we manage, and the assets, well, the liquid assets now are $130 billion plus.\n"}

But we don't have to put it in matching bonds or anything of the sort.  It goes into a general pool of assets, which we manage, and the assets, well, the liquid assets now are $130 billion plus.  But it goes in,  so it is not set aside in some little compartment like people like to think.  Now,  no other insurance company could do it,  but  they can't think that way.  They aren't even used to thinking that way,  but they can't think that way because they don't have our balance sheet.  We account for 26% or something like that of the net worth of all property casualty companies in the United States.   So,  so far, the payment that we have had to make have run modestly, and Ajit will correct me on this if I'm wrong, because he paid a lot of attention.  The amount we have had to pay has run slightly below the amount we anticipated having to pay in terms of our share of the losses.   But  it served AIG's purposes.  ->","completion":" It came to us with,  we're in a unique position.  There's nobody else that was  able to write that,  just like when we took on the Lloyds.\n"}
{"prompt":" No, one way to look at how the deal is  performing since we did the deal is,  at the point in  time when we did the deal,  we had made certain projections of  how much we will pay out each year.  And what we do is monitor what the actual payments are since the inception of  the deal, and how does that compare with what we expected to pay out.  As Warren mentioned,  these two numbers are very close to each other.  More specifically,  the actual payouts are  96% of what we had projected to pay out at this point in time,  which is good but not great.  We are still ahead of the curve.  If we do end up paying out less than what we projected,  not only would we have borrowed money at a very attractive rate,  meaning less than 4%, significantly less than 4%,  in addition to that,  we would have made a fee,  which in 2015 dollars would be a million dollars.  So we would have borrowed money at less than  4%, and we would have made a million dollar fee,  which is  slightly more than what we were expecting to do.  So net-net,  we are very happy with the deal.  We are happy we did it,  but the game is not over.  There are total liabilities that are coming down the pike every second day.  So I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will work out  better than what we expected it to work out.   Well, the really interesting thing is that  within Berkshire, the casualty insurance companies have four times as much stockholder capital  behind each dollar of premium volume.  Four times  normal. And of course we see the big deals.  Who would you trust if you had a big liability you wanted to dump on somebody? And we have $25 billion or more coming in from things other than insurance, uncorrelated to insurance, every year with no obligations.  We don't pay dividends.   If you paid dividends and  you cut your dividend,  try going around trying to write insurance the next day.  I mean, it's a business where the people are counting on you to pay.  And when we take that $10 billion, we don't agree to put it in five-year bonds and 10-year bonds.  We don't even think that way.  And the people that do business with us know that they have somebody like nobody else on those  – that's going to be able to pay $10 billion,  you know, no matter what happens to the economy.  So it's not only the presence of enormous strength in the insurance companies,  it's the fact we've got all these earnings that essentially come in every month. And we don't have a lot of debt. ->","completion":" I mean, we have debt at the railroad and the energy level. \n"}

I'm Marvin Blum, an estate planning lawyer from Fort Worth, Texas,  home to many of your companies.  In fact, Warren,  I met you at the memorial for our beloved Paul Andrews,  who was manager of TTI.  I'd like to get your thoughts on a widespread problem in the world of estate planning,  and that's the failure of most parents to prepare the next generation for the inheritance coming their way.  In particular,  if the estate includes a family business,  most parents fail to do  business succession planning to plan for who will run the business on the day when,  not if,  the founder is no longer there to run it.  The kids aren't prepared, unlike  King Charles – the other King Charles,  not King Charlie Munger –  who has been preparing  for his job as king of England now for more than 70 years.  I sometimes describe the situation like this.  Picture a football game.  At one end of the field is a quarterback.  He has great skills.  He throws a beautiful pass to the other end of the field.  And at the other end of the field are the receivers.  They've never been to a practice.  They don't know the rules of the game.  They don't know how to work together as a team.  They're clueless.  So the quarterback is the patriarch and the matriarch.  The football is the inheritance or the family business.  And  the receivers are the kids.  What are the odds that they're going to catch the football and go score a touchdown?  Probably only around 10%.  I've got the picture on the –  Just give me – No.  The – I probably observed as many – just because of my age and to some extent because of things like the giving pledges –  ->","completion":" I probably observed as many particularly wealthy families the problems,  and they all are – get very particular to the family.

{"prompt":" Greg?  Sure.   So it is a valid issue that our team obviously has been dealing with at BNSF.  We did move crude across that tribal land.  We had an agreement that allowed us to move X number of units per day,  and we did breach it.  We went over it.  There were some fundamental breakdowns  there in that our team didn't understand the number of  trains that they could move.  We have had significant discussions with the tribe looking to resolve the issue,  recognizing we obviously benefited from moving those trains,  and those type of discussions will  continue.  I would say there's lessons learned there that we have to,  when we make a commitment,  understand what that commitment is and live by it,  or don't assume we can just  move our trains as we wish,  or the cargo as we wish.  We have to respect those agreements.  So there's been a moment learned there,  but at the same time,  we've taken it very seriously and attempted to  reach a resolution there.  And at some point,  I hope we do come to a true resolution that's fair both to the tribe and to BNSF.  On the derailment side,  we did have an issue around the track derailed.  We worked very closely with the tribe to mitigate that issue instantly,  or at least over a very reasonable period of time.  They were very responsive.  Our team was very responsive.  And there were really no long-term environmental impacts to that spill.  And as our team's highlighted in other comments,  obviously, derailments do occur in the industry.  We take them incredibly serious.  They're not all hazardous,  but irrespective of that,  we're constantly looking at how do we prevent them?  How do we detect them when we potentially have one that's  going to occur?  And what do we do with our trains?  And then ultimately, it comes down to responding properly,  because they will occur. And I think we have an incredibly dedicated team that's always ready to respond to the communities they're impacting.  There are derailments.   How many a year?   Yeah, well, there's a thousand plus in the industry.  Yeah, yeah.   You start hauling freight,  and we're a common carrier.  And we take heavy, very heavy freight, and we take them at 100 degrees. ->","completion":" But it's the  weather, and we take it at zero. And we go around curves, and we have grades. And even a 1% grade if you're going down a hill with, I don't know how much weight behind you.  I mean,  railroading is not an easy business. And of course, the systems were designed basically in the  late 1800s, the mid to late 1800s. And we have 22,000, I think it is, miles of track. And that doesn't count sidings and some other things.  It is not an easy business.  We'll make mistakes.  Our job, we're not making a mistake because we have a derailment.  We will have derailments 10 and 20 years or 30 years from now.  And  we have to carry certain products we wish we didn't  have to carry.  We're a common carrier.  Do we like carrying chlorine and ammonia and all of that?  No.  But they're going to move from one place to another in this society,  and we are a common carrier. And we load them if they select our railroad.\n"}
{"prompt":" But  we are better than we used to be,  but we've got a long  way to go, I think.  Is that a fair enough statement?   Absolutely.   Yeah.  OK, station five.   Hi,  Mr.  Warren and Ms.  Munger.  My name is Su Jinghua from China,  Zhu Ning Long Dao Company.  And first of all,  I'm so excited and very honored to be here today.  And my question is,  with more and more people focusing on  environmental protection and the government supporting the new energy industry as well,  so what are your thoughts on the continued development of new energy?  How may the new  energy firm achieve better development in the future?  ->","completion":" Yeah, well, Greg, I think it's the best  to answer that because he,  since we bought a company called MidAmerican,  but now called Berkshire\n"}
{"prompt":" Yeah, well, Greg, I think it's the best  to answer that because he,  since we bought a company called MidAmerican,  but now called Berkshire  Hathaway Energy, but he has been talking about it yearly, preparing reports,  hoping that we can help solve a number of the problems.  And we probably spent more money than any utility,  I would guess, in the United States. And we've just scratched the surface.  But it is not easy when you cross state lines.  I mean, you've got different jurisdictions.  And this country should be ahead of where it is in terms of transmission. And we have been the biggest factor in helping that.  But why don't you tell them a little bit about it?  Sure.  Thanks, Warren.  So there's no question there's an energy transformation going on around the globe.  And as Warren touched on,  in the US, and in some ways,  I would hope here in the US, it would be,  we'd at least have a clear plan across the nation as to how to approach that.  But the reality is,  it is state by state,  with some exceptions.  But so as a result,  when you think of Berkshire Hathaway Energy,  we own three US utilities there.  And they'll participate in multiple states.  But they're developing plans state by state,  and then trying to integrate them across the various states.  The opportunities are significant,  because there is a transformation going on.  We've outlined our goal on where we're going relative to carbon at BHE, where they'll,  by 2030, reduce their carbon footprint by 50% relative to 2005.  So that's the Paris Accord and the standard they want to hold the utility industry or the utility companies to.  And we're well on that path.  But to achieve it is a true journey.  I've often talked to Warren,  when we bought Pacific Corp back in the mid-2000s,  we immediately recognized to build a lot of renewable energy like we'd been doing in the Midwest in Iowa.  But that was basically in a single state.  Now, Pacific Corp, we're in six states.  We started that back in the mid-2000s.  Here we are, and we laid out a great transmission plan.  Here's how we're going to build it.  Here's how we're going to  effectuate it, and all the benefits for our customers over that period of time.  Here we are in 2023,  and we have a little more than a third of that.  At the time, it was a $6 billion transmission project.  Today, we have a little more than a third of it built, and we've spent  probably closer to $7 billion.  And it's the right outcome.  It's still a great outcome for our customers.  But that transmission,  as part of the transformation,  you absolutely have to build it to remove all that renewable energy.  And that's sort of the complexity Warren was highlighting.  You can't just wake up one day and solve this problem.  You start with transmission,  and then you build the resources.  But at that same company,  and if we look at what we're doing across BHE Energy and that energy transformation,  we have $70 billion of known projects that are really required to properly serve our customers and achieve that type of energy transformation across those utilities.  And that's in the coming 10 years.   So  we have a team that's absolutely up to the challenge.  They're delivering on their commitments,  and it's a very good business opportunity for each of our companies and for our shareholders.  Because as we deploy that capital,  we obviously earn a return on equity of it.  But it will be a long journey.  It'll happen over an extended period of time.  And the further you get out there,  the more dependent upon the evolution of a variety of technologies  that are progressing but not there yet.  You've raised a question.  I want to just take an extra minute on it because it's so important.  And I don't really know whether our form of government is ideal at all in terms of solving the problem you describe.  We have solved at one time in World War II,  we took a country that was semi-limping along, and we found ourselves in a world war.  And what we did in a world war is we brought a bunch of people to Washington at a dollar a year,  whether it was Sidney Weinberg or Goldman Sachs, you just name them.  And we gave them enormous power to reorient the resources of the United States to face the problem that they faced, which was to create a war machine. And what they did was they found Henry Kaiser and told him to build ships. And they went to the Ford Motor Company and said, you build tanks and some airplanes. And they reordered the industrial enterprise of the United States in a way that was unbelievable because they had the power of the federal government and they had the ingenuity of American business.  And they had the facilities of American business. And it led to a very successful outcome. ->","completion":" But can we do that in a peacetime where you've got 50 states and  you have to get them to cooperate and you don't have anyone that, you can issue orders, but you can't designate where the capital goes at the other end and we try and do it with tax incentives and all that sort of thing.  But we haven't created the unity of purpose and the machinery that worked in World War II where essentially everybody felt  their one job was to win the war and we figured out how to use our industrial capacity to, in effect, defeat the Axis powers. And how do you recreate that  with the present democratic system?\n"}
{"prompt":" The objective is obvious.  And we just don't seem to be able to do it  in a peacetime where we're used to following a given set of  procedure. And China's got one country and we've got 50 states and we've got a whole different system of government that we should be up to the test, but so far it hasn't worked.  So thank you for the question.  Becky?   This question comes from Chris Freed in Philadelphia.  He says, we know that Greg Abel and Ajit Jain are the next generation of Berkshire leaders.  Who are currently behind Greg and Ajit in their respective roles?   Respective.   Well, that  will be the question that they give their, well, Greg will be, at some things, an extraordinary circumstance, but he's going to succeed me. And then he will have,  be sitting in a position where he needs his equivalent or something close to his equivalent, because he's better at many things than I've been.  He will need that substitute.  And when the question comes,  where we know Ajit's opinion on that, but Greg will probably be the one that will make the final decision.  I mean, it's his responsibility.  And  Ajit will give him his best advice. And I think the odds are very, very, very high that Greg would follow it.  But those are not easy questions.  ->","completion":" It isn't like we've,  everybody talks about the executive bench and all of that sort of thing,  which is baloney.  I mean, you don't have that many people that  can run five, the largest gap net worth company, and all kinds of diverse businesses.  But you don't need five people either. And you need a lot of good operating managers, and you need somebody at the top that allocates capital and make sure that  you've got the right operating manager.  And we've designed something where we separate the insurance and the rest of the business, and I think it's a very good design.\n"}
{"prompt":" So the challenges are huge.  Our government always looks,  you know, my dad was in Congress back in the 1940s, and it looked like a mess then,  you know, although it was unified by the war to some degree, but it was still very partisan.  Now, the problem we have,  I think, is that partisanship, it seems to me, has moved toward tribalism, and tribalism just doesn't work as well.  I mean,  when it gets to tribalism, you don't even hear the other side, and tribalism can lead to mobs.  I mean, it just, it flows.   I mean, you've seen it elsewhere,  we've seen it to a degree here.  So we have to refine in a certain way our democracy as we go along,  and we deal with the world we live in.  But  if I still had a choice of any place to be born in the world, I'd want to be born in the United States, and I'd want to be born today. ->","completion":" I mean, it is a better world than we've ever had,  and with present-day communications,  we can also see much more how terrible it is in many ways.  And it's got problems.\n"}

I mean, it is a better world than we've ever had,  and with present-day communications,  we can also see much more how terrible it is in many ways.  And it's got problems.  When I was born in 1930,  there were 2 billion people in the world,  and now there's maybe 7.7 billion and growing. And we went millennia with really no change in population. ->","completion":" So we,  and of course, we've introduced energy into, in an incredible way,  into something where we now have 7.7 billion people using way more energy than they did when I was born,  when there were 2 billion people.\n"}
{"prompt":" Yes, I would.  And I like more wealth managers who are just merely reflecting the fact that there's more wealth.  But we've got…  I don't like everybody going into wealth management,  MIT or something.  I think the world's a little crazy now.   Take your choice.  Okay, Becky.  This  question comes from Dennis DeGennaro.  As Warren stated in the 2022 annual report,  Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash in U.S.  Treasury bills.   It will also avoid behavior  that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times,  including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses.  After Warren passes away,  his A shares will be converted into  B shares and distributed to various foundations.  These foundations will then sell the shares  to fund their causes.  Warren estimates it will take 12 to 15 years for all his shares to be sold.  I worry that a corporate raider like Kyral Icahn or a group will buy up enough  of these shares to take control of Berkshire and completely disregard Warren's philosophy  of holding a lot of cash in U.S.  Treasury bills and instead be greedy,  reckless, and highly speculative and ruin Berkshire's position as a rock-solid financial fortress.  I also worry that changes might be made in how Berkshire's subsidiaries are run.  Do Warren and Charlie worry that these things could happen?   Well,  I think it's fair to say we think about it plenty,  but I don't worry enormously.  ->","completion":" It is true that \n"}

It is true that   Greg and the directors will have a honeymoon period for a long time simply because of the boats that will still remain.  But it's true that eventually they will get judged based on how well our operation fares versus others.  ->","completion":" Now, if we don't  pay any dividends in 12 or 15 years,  you're talking a trillion and a half that it would take to take over. And I think if we can't—that limits the group.\n"}
{"prompt":" More things will have happened where our hundreds of billions can work its way into the economy in terms of  lots of jobs, lots of products,  lots of behavior.  And it can be compared with other things.  So I  think we went out if we deserve to went out.  And I think the odds of that happening are very, very, very high.  Charlie?   Well, we—I don't spend much time worrying about something that could have happened 50 years ago,  and after I'm dead.  I think if you sort of take care of each day's responsibilities pretty well and  think ahead as well as you can,  then you just take the results as they fall.  So I'm philosophical,  but I'm not—I'd be spreading unnecessarily.   OK.  Neither one of us are worried,  basically.  But we plan.   We do plan.  ->","completion":" And, you know, I've got a model in my mind of what \n"}
{"prompt":" And, you know, I've got a model in my mind of what   Berkshire has been.  That model has been modified plenty of times over 58 years.  The one thing I knew initially is—or very quickly—was it shouldn't be a textile company.  That was an important decision.  And we've just played the hand as it's come along,  and we've made a few really good decisions,  and we'll never make a decision that kills us.  The only things that are a threat to the planet,  we don't have any answer for those.  But  we do—we keep ourselves in better shape  than anybody else, and we just aren't going to have big maturities of debt that come along.  We aren't going to have  insurance policies that can be cashed in en masse,  and we will sit with a large—what looks like a huge amount of capital.  It is a huge amount of capital,  but there's a huge amount of earning power.  There's a huge amount of diversity, everything.  So our business model will be graded,  and it will be graded against a lot of people that we'd like to be graded against.   So I think we're handing something very secure over to the future,  and I think we've got the shareholder base like nobody has.  I mean, there isn't anybody in the country that I know of,  unless they've had an  employee-owned company prior to going public or something of the sort.  But this is the product of  58 years of regarding the shareholder as the owner of the company.  But what does that mean?   That means having happy customers.  ->","completion":" It means being—it means being welcomed by your community rather than having them turn you away.  It means that the government feels better with you if there's a financial crisis,  because you can provide something that actually the company—the country can't under some circumstances,  and you'll be there. And at the same time, it'll be good for the business. And we will have crises of one sort or another, but  if they aren't challenging the planet,  which worries you in terms of some of the threats that we have, we'll be a plus to the United States, and if we're a plus to the United States, we'll survive.\n"}

Okay.  Station 7.  Mr.   Buffett and Mr.   Munger,  thank you for having us this weekend.  My name is Beau Clayton,  and I'm from Durham, North Carolina.  One of the reasons that we are all here is that you're great storytellers,  and we carry those stories back home with us.  Can you please share a couple stories that maybe we haven't heard before about Mr.  Abel and Mr.  Jane that capture their character and their caliber as leaders?  Well,  I'll start out with the G.  He walked into the office in  1986,  and I'd gotten the bright idea of going into the reinsurance business, I think, in maybe 1969.  So I'd stumbled along for 17 years,  and I had a wonderful guy that ran it, but he also liked certain brokers. ->","completion":" I mean, he was running it  the traditional way, the top quality and everything else, but  he fell into the—he didn't try and change the system.  He tried to improve the system to some degree, and we just—we went nowhere.\n"}
{"prompt":" Well, he was there.   But you've got to recognize him.   I asked Louis once how he managed to play first-string football at, I think, Stanford,  when he only weighed 175 pounds.  And he said, well, he said, I was pretty quick.  And he was pretty quick.  We have found a lot of people within our companies who are pretty quick.   We had one guy that quit at fourth grade,  didn't we, in Ben Rosner.  Am I wrong?   Oh, yeah, totally self-educated.  Ben Rosner knew more about retailing in difficult neighborhoods than anybody.  And he watched everything in his business like a hawk.  He was amazing.  Now, there was an example.  We never found anybody who could do what—when Ben died,  that ability left us.  ->","completion":" Yeah, and you want a story,  it's kind of interesting,  because Ben Rosner had a partner, Leo Simon.  And Leo Simon was Mo Annenberg's son-in-law. And Leo, therefore, was very, very, very wealthy. And Ben started with nothing.  But they liked each other.  And one time,  well before they got involved in the business, the business we bought—but  they got the idea of buying a submarine from World War I and taking it to the Century of Progress,  which was the World's Fair,  in effect, in Chicago, I think, in 1933.  So they bought the submarine for practically nothing.  And they figured, you know, the average guy from Omaha was going to his first World's Fair,  get into a submarine for a quarter or  something, that they'd pay it.  So they hauled it  from Florida, wherever they got it.\n"}
{"prompt":" They hauled it to Chicago.  And then they got into Chicago, and they were hauling a submarine down the streets of Chicago.  And it was creating traffic problems like nobody could imagine.  So a cop came over,  and he said to Ben, he said, where do you think you guys are going  with that submarine?  Ben says,  he says, well, I don't—he says, you'll have to talk to  my partner, Mr.  Capone.  And the cop says, you're on.  Just keep going.  And that was Ben Rosner.  And then Leo Simon died.  And when he died in 1967 or so,  Ben Rosner kept delivering  half the profits to his widow,  who was incredibly rich, of course, being Mo Annenberg's  firstborn daughter.  I think Mo had nine girls in a row before Walter came along,  the tenth. ->","completion":" I may be off by one.  But anyway,  I went to this fancy apartment.  And anyway, Ben kept her in for half the deal. And he had her sign the rent checks,  just so she would look like she was doing something in this business. And she didn't need the money, obviously, but he just felt he was  obligated once his partner Leo died.  And then she started criticizing him. And at that point, Ben went to her—his lawyer—or it was her lawyer, actually, Will Fahlsteiner.\n"}

I don't know whatever happened to Will,  but he gave me—he gave me a call,  because Ben wanted to call me, because he wanted me to buy it. And he wanted me—if I bought it, he'd be rid of the partner's—ex-partner's wife. And he'd get—he had me and Charlie come back, and we went to Will Fahlsteiner's office.  And Ben says, I'll work till the  end of the year, and that's all,  but I'll sell you this thing for $6 million,  and I have $2 million of cash and a couple million of real estate and a couple million of operating earnings.  I said, this is crazy.  But  he felt if he was getting a lousy price,  she was taking a half of the lousy price for half the money.  ->","completion":" So he looked at me at some point. \n"}
{"prompt":" I got Charlie on the side.  I said,  if this guy leaves at the end of the year,  you can throw away every psychology book that's ever been written.  I mean, it isn't going to happen.  And so we bought it, and we lived happily ever after with Ben. And one time, he was taking me over to see a property we had in Brooklyn. And along the way, I said, Ben, I promised you I wouldn't interfere in the business when we started.  And he knew a but was coming,  and he just said, thank you, Warren. And then he shut me up.  He was a lot of fun.   We have so many Ben Rosner stories,  but now you've heard one that hasn't been published before.  OK, Becky.   This question comes from Chai Gohil.  He writes—this is for Ajit—reinsurance industry is going through one of the hardest pricing environments in the last 15 years.  Berkshire historically has participated during these stress times when economic returns are very attractive.  This year, it appears Berkshire has not been interested in deploying its resources towards property cat reinsurance despite such strong returns.  Can you elaborate on reasons for not participating despite these returns?  And your broader view on how you're planning to shape your reinsurance business post-acquisition of Allegheny?   OK.  ->","completion":" In terms of Allegheny,  that's an easy response.  We look—we treat our operating units independent of each other.  And as far as Allegheny is concerned,  they have a major presence in the reinsurance business  under the brand name of Transatlantic \n"}

Now,  in terms of the property cat business that I have been active in over these last several years,  you are right that the last 15 years  has been a difficult time.  Prices have not been attractive.  And even though we have had some presence in the property cat business in the last 15 years,  it really has been minimal.  This December 31st, which is a big renewal date for cat reinsurance,  we were hoping that we would get a few days in the sun and we'd be able to deploy our capital and  be able to write some fairly attractive business.  As it happened towards the end of  December, till about the third week of December,  I was very optimistic that we would get a chance to  put several billion dollars on the books.  But in the last 10 days of December,  unfortunately,  a lot of capacity came out of the woodworks.  Pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come  and meet our pricing requirements,  as a result of which  January 1 was a big disappointment.  We did not write as much as we were hoping to write.  Now, fast forward to April 1,  which is another big renewal date,  we had a lot of powder dry.  And we were lucky that we kept the powder dry,  because April 1, suddenly prices zoomed up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1  and started to look attractive to us.  So now we have a portfolio that is very heavily exposed to property catastrophe.  To put that in perspective,  our exposure today is almost 50%  more than what it was five, six months ago.  So I think we have written as much as our capacity will  allow us to write.  We are very happy with what we've written.  ->","completion":" The margins have been healthy.  The only thing that I want to mention to you is that while  the margins have been healthy,  we have a very unbalanced portfolio.  What that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida,  we will have a very substantial loss.  As opposed to that,  if we have a very big loss anywhere other than Florida,  relative to our competition,  we will have a much smaller loss.  Net-net,  I'm very happy with the portfolio.  It is a lot better than what it's been in the past.  I don't know how long it will last.  And of course,  if the hurricane happens in Florida,  we could lose,  across all the units,  we could lose as much as $15 billion.  And if there isn't a loss,  we'll make several billion dollars' profit. \n"}

Pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come  and meet our pricing requirements,  as a result of which  January 1 was a big disappointment.  We did not write as much as we were hoping to write.  Now, fast forward to April 1,  which is another big renewal date,  we had a lot of powder dry.  And we were lucky that we kept the powder dry,  because April 1, suddenly prices zoomed up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1  and started to look attractive to us.  So now we have a portfolio that is very heavily exposed to property catastrophe.  To put that in perspective,  our exposure today is almost 50%  more than what it was five, six months ago.  So I think we have written as much as our capacity will  allow us to write.  We are very happy with what we've written.   The margins have been healthy.  The only thing that I want to mention to you is that while  the margins have been healthy,  we have a very unbalanced portfolio.  What that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida,  we will have a very substantial loss.  As opposed to that,  if we have a very big loss anywhere other than Florida,  relative to our competition,  we will have a much smaller loss.  Net-net,  I'm very happy with the portfolio.  It is a lot better than what it's been in the past.  I don't know how long it will last.  And of course,  if the hurricane happens in Florida,  we could lose,  across all the units,  we could lose as much as $15 billion.  And if there isn't a loss,  we'll make several billion dollars' profit.   And, G, tell them how long,  when you called me and said you'd like to expose us to whatever it was,  a couple billion more of exposure,  how long it took to say yes?  Yeah.  ->","completion":" So the way we think about our exposure is,  you know, in the property, in the insurance operations collectively across the entire company,  given that we have about a little less than $300 billion of capital,  we think of that as a 5% exposure that we're willing to take on. \n"}
{"prompt":" We don't have to make promises.  We get a chance to make our own  mistakes and occasionally find something that works well.  But we recognize that  the people in this room and people like them are the ones we're working for, and we're not working for a bunch of people that care about whether we meet the quarter estimate or anything.  So we have a freedom that we get to use.  And we're interested in owning a wonderful business forever.  Well, there aren't very many wonderful businesses,  but we do learn a lot as we go along.  Charlie and I have often mentioned how we learned so much when we bought See's Candy,  which we did.  But we learned when we bought Ben Rogers'  chain of women's dress shops spread all over the eastern part of the country.  We learned when we tried getting into the department store business back in 1966.  And as the ink was drying on our purchase price, we realized we'd done something dumb.  We're learning all the time how consumers behave.   I'm not going to be able to learn the technical aspects of businesses,  but that would be nice if I knew it.  But it isn't essential.  And  we are obviously, we've got a business at Apple which is larger than our energy business. And we may only own 5.6 or 7 percent, but our ownership goes up every year.  And I don't understand the phone at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.  And I know how people think about whether to buy a second car.  I know how they go out to different,  we own auto dealerships. ->","completion":" We're learning all the time from all of our businesses how people react to animals versus selling them something else.  And so See's was a sort of breakthrough,  but we just keep learning as to more about how people behave and how a good business can turn into a bad business and how some good businesses can maintain their competitive advantage over time. And so we don't have some formula.\n"}
{"prompt":" We get a little wiser though,  following it over time.  And you can do it while sitting in the office with a telephone too, which we like.  Charlie?  Well, tell them the story of the Japanese investment.  That should be told again.   That's  a nice story.  Yeah.  Well, it was pretty simple.  I mean, I,  you know, back  when I started, other people were going through Playboy and I was going through Moody's, you know, basically.  And there's a movie out called Turn Every Page,  which I saw again for the second time a couple of days ago.  Lizzie Gottlieb and I recommend everybody in this world watch that because I turned every page in the past. And I did it for thousands and thousands of pages in Moody's and I did it at the Department of Public Utilities in  Boston.   I did it in the insurance department.  It just kept turning pages.  Well,  that goes on for a while, but now we need big ideas in order to find things. And what was your question, Charlie?  Tell them about the Japanese.  ->","completion":" Well, the Japanese thing was simple.  I mean, I like looking at companies.  I mean, I like looking at  figures about companies. And here were five very, very substantial companies, understandable companies.\n"}

And what was your question, Charlie?  Tell them about the Japanese.   Well, the Japanese thing was simple.  I mean, I like looking at companies.  I mean, I like looking at  figures about companies. And here were five very, very substantial companies, understandable companies.  Most of them,  maybe all of them, we'd done business with in a dozen different ways.  If you go a couple of miles from where this place is,  our last coal generating plant was built.  By one of the companies.   So here they were.   They were sitting as a group  where they were earning,  we'll say, 14 percent  on what we were going to pay to buy them.  They were paying decent dividends.  They were going to repurchase shares in some cases.  They owned a whole bunch of businesses that we could understand as a group, although we didn't mean we had deep understanding on any of them.  But we've seen them operate and everything.  ->","completion":" There wasn't anything to it.  And at the same time,  we could take out the currency risk by financing in yen.  And that was going to cost us a half of one percent.  Well, if you get 14 percent on one side,  a half a percent on the other side. And you've got money that, you know,  forever. And they're doing intelligent things and they're sizable.\n"}

Well, if you get 14 percent on one side,  a half a percent on the other side. And you've got money that, you know,  forever. And they're doing intelligent things and they're sizable.  So  we just started buying them.  I didn't even probably tell Greg until maybe six months  after we'd gotten going.  And then when we hit five percent  in all of them,  we announced on my birthday and at 90,  that we owned over five percent and recently went over for the first time to visit with them. And we were more than pleasantly surprised, delighted with what we find there. And now we own 7.4 percent of them.  We won't go over 9.9 without their agreeing.  And we sold another 164, whatever it is. ->","completion":" A billion of yen. \n"}
{"prompt":" I mean, I knew he'd like it.  I mean, obviously.  And we tried to do every dollar we could do.   We could only do about 10 billion.   Yeah.   Well, not even that.   Quite that much.  Yeah.   But, you know,  we are four or five billion ahead plus dividends.  And we got a carry that's terrific. And and,  you know, and they welcome us and they should welcome us. And but we we love it the way they're operating. ->","completion":" We're not there to tell them what to do in the least.  So we did. \n"}

But we did say we never go over nine point nine and we mean it.  And they they know that  we'll be true to our word. And I went over there partly to introduce Greg to those people,  because we're going to be with them 10,  20, 30, 40 years from now.  And they may occasionally find something that we can do jointly.  And they look they look forward to doing that.  We look forward to it.  And in addition, we have some other operating businesses in Japan.  So,  Greg, do you have anything?  The only thing I would add is that one is more than you went over there.  It was to build the build the trust with these Japanese companies,  because we do hope there's long term opportunities.  But fundamentally, as you highlighted,  they're an incredible they've been a very good investment.  I'd also highlight the five meetings we had  were really quite remarkable.  I mean, these companies,  the culture and the history around it,  how proud they are.  You know, there's just moments of learning from them.  So it was just a great experience to to spend really two days with the five companies.  And an issue that we intended to be 56 billion yen that we were issuing and selling turned out to be one hundred and sixty four point four or something like that.  Everything everything's worked so well.  And as Charlie says,  it you know, it doesn't move 500 billion of net worth that much. ->","completion":" But this one is,  you know, it will keep adding over the years to the Berkshire's value with very widespread,  probably four or five hundred million dollars a year.\n"}
{"prompt":" And, you know, we'll just keep looking for more opportunities.  And and Japan,  we have  Berkshire is the largest borrower outside of corporate borrow outside of  Japan that that exists.  And we didn't set out to be that.  It's it's turned out that way. And and we're not done.  I mean, you know, in terms of  what may come along there.  And we have some direct operations there, as I mentioned.  And we've got some really wonderful partners working for us. And I don't have to do anything.  OK, Becky.   The next question comes from Ellie Amin, Tibet,  who asks during an episode of investing the Templeton Way podcast, Professor Damodaran,  who he respects almost as much as Warren and Charlie mentioned that he is not comfortable with positions becoming a large part of his portfolio,  for example, when they reach twenty five to thirty five percent.  He mentioned that Apple is now thirty five percent of Berkshire's portfolio and thinks that that is near a danger zone.  Wonders if Warren and Charlie can comment.   I'll leave him in one comment first,  but Charlie will come up with.   I think he's out of his mind.  ->","completion":" Yeah, I know.  But  Apple is not thirty five percent of a Berkshire portfolio.  Berkshire's portfolio includes the railroad,  the energy business, animals,  you name it, sees candy.  They're all businesses.  And,  you know, the good thing about Apple is that we we can go up.  They buy in their stock and instead of owning five point six percent,  you know, they get down to they got about fifteen billion, seven hundred and some million shares outstanding.\n"}

They buy in their stock and instead of owning five point six percent,  you know, they get down to they got about fifteen billion, seven hundred and some million shares outstanding.  They get down to fifteen and a quarter billion without us doing anything.  We got six percent.  So we can't own more than one hundred percent of the world.  BNSF, we can't own more than one hundred percent of animals or sees candy.  And it'd be nice.  We'd love to own 200 percent,  but this isn't doable.  But they're all the same.  They're good businesses.  And to think that  our criterion,  our criteria for Apple is different  than the other businesses we own.  It just happens to be a better business than any we own.  And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad. And Apple is a better business.  Our railroad is a very good business,  but it's not remotely as good as Apple's business.  But  Apple has a position with consumers where they're paying, you know, maybe they pay fifteen hundred bucks or whatever it may be for a phone.  And these same people pay thirty five thousand dollars for having a second car.  And if they had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car.  I mean, it's an extraordinary problem.   We don't have anything like that that we own a hundred percent of.  ->","completion":" But we're very, very, very happy to have five point six or whatever it may be percent.  And we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up.  It's like adding one hundred million dollars to our earnings.  I mean, our share of the earnings.  And they use their earnings to buy out  our partners, which we're glad to see them sell out to the index funds have to sell.  They bring the number of shares down.  And,  you know, we went up slightly last year and I made a mistake a couple of years ago when I sold some shares.\n"}

I had  certain certain reasons why gains were useful to take that year from a tax standpoint.  But having heard having heard me say that it was a dumb decision.  And.   Well, you've already given your comment about it,  but but we do not have thirty five percent of Berkshire's portfolio.  Berkshire's portfolio is the  funds we have to work with and we want to own good businesses and we also want to have plenty of liquidity.  And beyond that,  you know, the sky's the limit or  or our mistakes.  Who knows what the bottom is?  Charlie, do you want to add anything to your earlier comment?  Well, I think.  One of the inane things that's taught in modern university education is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory and investing in common stocks.  That is an insane idea.  It's not that easy to have a vast plethora of  good opportunities that are easily identified.  And if you've only got three,  I'd rather be in my best ideas instead of my worst.  ->","completion":" And. \n"}

I'm also here with my two sons,  Aidan and Ashton, who's currently studying at University of Chicago as a freshman and sophomore.  This is my second time attending the conference,  last being 2019,  four years ago,  which I was only a guest shareholder of my friend Andrew.  So  after the shareholder meeting,  I have decided to buy into Berkshire Hathaway,  which has given me a great return of 62 percent since 2019.  So I want to thank you for that.  I have also taken one of your advice to give my children a share for each of their birthdays.  Although they want a Berkshire Hathaway A shares,  they will do just fine with B shares.  My question is,  how do you see the current U.S.  China Internet companies valuation and the price disparity?  Given there has been many uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions,  significant cost optimizations with leaner U.S.  tech firms,  while China Tech has been through all that already.  Thank you.  Well,  there's been some tension in the economic relationship of  the United States and China.  I think that  that tension has been wrongly created on both sides.  I think we're equally guilty of being stupid.  There's one thing we should do.  It's get along on the other side.  I think we should get along on the other side.   I think we're equally guilty of being stupid.  There's one thing we should do.  It's get along with China.  And we should have a lot of free trade with China in our mutual interest.  And I just can't imagine.  It's just so obvious.  There's so much safety and so much creativity that's possible.  Think of what Apple has done by engaging in a  partnership with China as a big supplier.  It's been good for Apple and good for China.  That's the kind of business we ought to be doing with China.  And moreover, everything that increases the tension between the two companies is stupid,  stupid, stupid.  And it ought to be stopped on each side.  And each side ought to respond to the other side's stupidity with reciprocal kindness.  That's my view.

And the two are not just compatible, they're almost imperative in terms of what's going to happen in the next 100 years or so. And I think that the leaders of both countries have got an important job in having that  understood and not to do inflammatory things. And we'll see whether the luck that has taken us from 1945 to present holds out.  And I think we can affect to some extent that luck.  And with that shory message,  we will move to Becky.  This question comes from Rohit Bellany.  Berkshire bought a substantial position in Taiwan Semiconductor and,  contrary to its normal holding timeline,  sold almost the entire position within a few short months.  While you cited in a CNBC interview that geopolitical issues were the catalyst,  these issues were seemingly no different when you acquired that stock.  So what else, if anything, changed in those few months and prompted the firm to offload close to $5 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor shares?   Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the best  managed companies and important companies in the world.  And I think you'll be able to say the same thing five or ten or twenty years from now.  I don't like its location and I've re-evaluated that.  I  mean, I don't think it should be any place but Taiwan,  although they will be obviously opening up  ship capacity in this country. And actually, one of our subsidiaries that we got in Allegheny is participating in their Arizona construction activities. ->","completion":" But  it's a question of we would rather have the same kind of company.

{"prompt":" Put that in the minutes.   Okay,  station 10.  First of all,  thank you for making our lives better.  My name is Bogumil Baranowski.  I'm a founding partner of Sika's Soshitsu in New York.  We manage multi-generational family fortunes,  hence my question.  Mr.  Buffett,  in 1976,  in your tribute to Benjamin Graham,  you wrote,  Walter Lippman spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit under.  Ben Graham was such a man.  You're both such people.  Could you share with us your 100-year vision for Berkshire?  It's a question to you both.  Yeah, I would like to add one thing about Ben Graham.  Ben Graham did all kinds of things for me,  and he never expected one thing in return.  I mean, just you name it,  and he did it. And there wasn't any hidden, you know, or a hint, I should say, of anything he expected in return. And I  checked—well, he wrote a book in 1949 that, in a sense, said to me in very persuasive terms that what I'd been spending my previous eight or nine years working at and loving was all wrong. And that book has been—I check it every now and then on Amazon to where it ranks, and, you know, Amazon ranks hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of books by sales. And Ben Graham's book has been up there, like, number 300 or 350 or something like that forever. And there isn't any book like that.  I wrote  Harper Collins a note the other day,  because they're bringing out another edition.  And I asked them how many copies had been sold,  and they said the records didn't go back  far enough.  But they had 7.3 million copies of this little book  that changed my life and continues to outsell every investment book,  and investment books come along, and, you know, they're number 400 or 1 ,000 or something for a while,  and then all of a sudden they're numbered 25 ->","completion":" ,000 or 200,000.  And this book, you know, in how many areas can you find any book that has had that sustained position?

Cookbooks,  maybe one or two of them last for a while,  but there is nothing.

And if so, we'll be very happy.  Charlie?   Yeah, one of the really interesting things about  Ben—he was a really gifted teacher,  a very honorable profession.  And that is what has lasted.  ->","completion":" However,  an interesting fact that he was sheepish about in his old age was that more than half of all the investment return that Ben Graham made in his whole life  came from one stock,  one growth stock, GEICO, Berkshire's subsidiary.  And at the time he operated,  there were a lot of sort of lousy companies that were too cheap,  and you could make a little money floating from one to another.  But the big money he made was one growth stock.  Buying one undervalued great company is a very good thing,  as Berkshire has found out again and again and again. And Ben wrote a postscript to the 49 edition pointing out exactly that fact and acknowledging it,  but also took some good lessons from it.  You know, he said, that's the way life is,  that  you prepare and you don't lose everything along the way, and then something comes along. And GEICO came along because a banker in Fort Worth that had financed Leo Davison—and I think the banker got three-quarters of it,  and I don't mean Leo Davison, Leo Goodwin,  who founded GEICO,  then called Government Employees Insurance Company, and you can figure out the acronym.

What will GEICO do to combat this?   Yeah,  so GEICO is talking to a number of original equipment manufacturers as well to try and see how best they can  work with the automobile manufacturer and offer insurance at the point of sale.

Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger,  and Berkshire Vice-Chairs,  Greg Abel and Ajit Jain just made in the Q&A session.  As Warren mentioned, they got through 25 questions.   Uh...  a lot of them pretty wide ranging at the top.  But it did say that the way things are tracking right now,  most of Berkshire's operating businesses look like they'll be down in earnings for 2023.  So the broader economic slowdown is reaching them.  Broad exposure to railroads.  Uh...  and uh...  building products as well as energy.  And a lot of consumer areas.  So that's probably not a surprise,  but it is a contrast to the rise in operating earnings they had in the first quarter.  Now, on Apple,  in response to a shareholder question that Apple was becoming a very large percentage of the investment portfolio,  some 35%, according to the question actually,  it's approaching half of the equity securities in the portfolio.  And Warren Buffett said that's not the way they think about it.  They think about their entire business as being the portfolio.  So Apple is not a particular asset.  It's a relatively large share.  If you consider the companies,  the businesses that they own outright,  and therefore,  he also said Apple is a much better business than any one of their operating businesses.  They wish probably they could own all of it,  but right for now,  they own almost 6%.  Apple keeps buying back a ton of stock,  which raises Berkshire's proportion of the whole company,  which they're pretty happy with at the moment.  Buffett also said in response to a question about how he quickly sold out of Taiwan semiconductor after having built a stake not long before.  Buffett said he feels just his capital is safer in Japan than in Taiwan.  They're a little concerned,  obviously, about geopolitical tensions in Japan.  In Taiwan, excuse me, really does like the investments in the Japanese trading houses financed with very inexpensive borrowings in yen.  So that was essentially some of the headlines out there.  A lot of skeptical comments about AI in response to some questions as to,  we're going to get to a lot of those details.  Meanwhile, cmbc.com's banking reporter Hugh Son at CNBC headquarters right now.  And Hugh, you know, Warren and Charlie didn't spend a whole lot of time this morning talking about the banks.  So despite all the recent regional banking turmoil,  they didn't really get many pointed questions on it,  but did get one.  I wonder what you make of that. ->","completion":" Yeah. \n"}
{"prompt":" Uh...  and uh...  building products as well as energy.  And a lot of consumer areas.  So that's probably not a surprise,  but it is a contrast to the rise in operating earnings they had in the first quarter.  Now, on Apple,  in response to a shareholder question that Apple was becoming a very large percentage of the investment portfolio,  some 35%, according to the question actually,  it's approaching half of the equity securities in the portfolio.  And Warren Buffett said that's not the way they think about it.  They think about their entire business as being the portfolio.  So Apple is not a particular asset.  It's a relatively large share.  If you consider the companies,  the businesses that they own outright,  and therefore,  he also said Apple is a much better business than any one of their operating businesses.  They wish probably they could own all of it,  but right for now,  they own almost 6%.  Apple keeps buying back a ton of stock,  which raises Berkshire's proportion of the whole company,  which they're pretty happy with at the moment.  Buffett also said in response to a question about how he quickly sold out of Taiwan semiconductor after having built a stake not long before.  Buffett said he feels just his capital is safer in Japan than in Taiwan.  They're a little concerned,  obviously, about geopolitical tensions in Japan.  In Taiwan, excuse me, really does like the investments in the Japanese trading houses financed with very inexpensive borrowings in yen.  So that was essentially some of the headlines out there.  A lot of skeptical comments about AI in response to some questions as to,  we're going to get to a lot of those details.  Meanwhile, cmbc.com's banking reporter Hugh Son at CNBC headquarters right now.  And Hugh, you know, Warren and Charlie didn't spend a whole lot of time this morning talking about the banks.  So despite all the recent regional banking turmoil,  they didn't really get many pointed questions on it,  but did get one.  I wonder what you make of that.  Yeah.   So the one question they did.  It was the very first of the day,  which was, you know, what would have happened to,  you know, to the U.S.  if SVB's uninsured depositors were allowed to go under.  And Warren was very clear on that.  He said that he would have led to a disaster that essentially it would have led to a run and every bank in the country,  the following morning.  So essentially an important thing to do.  I think, you know, for my money, it is more interesting about what he hasn't said than what he has,  which is, you know, we're at a moment in this country where,  you know, the business model of regional banking is under a lot of money.  He's retired market is prettyyear all of that into think you know,  we're trying to have this sort of capital policy.  unnecessary profit, we are going to get an explicit key to the loss of GM and the  market, that he has provided capital he has provided confidence to the US banking industry time and time again and so we're all dying really just to figure out what he's going to say.  And you know,  if he doesn't say anything about this,  I would point to the idea that perhaps it is a bit early to get involved in banks I mean he's given pretty negative comments or Becky quick but only last month about his prospects for banking and and that's certainly one of the things I want to hear.   Yeah, for sure and I guess you might also be able to argue that the particular banks that are most under pressure right now are relatively small.  They're literally regional.  They're restricted to small parts of the country.  They're not necessarily big long term franchises that would meet the other investment criteria perhaps that he might look for but it is interesting that he did not really change his holdings in this latest quarter in Bank of America in city group presumably.  So that would suggest that there's not a general condition.  I'm not concerned about the overall system but maybe also at least as far as we know did not find fresh reason to extend capital to some of the struggling banks.   Yeah, I mean, you know, he spent the last three years cutting his stakes banks.  You know, at 1.20, 19,  2018.  He loaded up on JV Morgan Goldman Sachs and had a significant stake in Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo historically had been one of their biggest holdings and he'd paired back after their fake account scandal.  So, and you know, more recently he's paired back in the United States.  He's a big member of the PNC and US Bank Corp.  ->","completion":" So,  certainly I think, you know, the general sort of idea is that he's loath to own banks heading into a potential economic downturn and certainly that's still the case where we are to this day.

{"prompt":" What I miss.   Well, I mentioned what he had to say about Apple.   Essentially,  he's not worried about it getting to be too big a position because he views it holistically within the entirety of Berkshire, not just the equity portfolio.  You and I had talked about it.  I can't remember if we were on camera when we were discussing this.  But just talking about what a big position it is.  You know, if you don't think about it from his perspective, I hadn't,  just in terms of,  OK, you're not talking about a stock portfolio,  you are talking about an overall portfolio of a company.  And the amount that goes into it.  What kind of stunned me is the idea that he said Apple is a better business than any of the businesses that we own in whole.   Exactly.  Without it, we did mention that that's a big headline.  And, you know, and he said, look, we have great businesses.  We have a great railroad and all the rest of it.  But I think just that's what the numbers would tell you.   Yeah.  And just in terms of the profitability,  the sustainability of profit margins,  the loyal, the sustainability of the customers.  So it was interesting.  He also, you know, he's got a lot of things working in his favor,  which is, as he said, Apple continues to buy back shares from everybody else but him.  Yeah.  And raising his ownership stake in the business.  You know, it occurred me at the time.  Maybe we'll get a chance to ask him this at some point.  But if that's the case,  why don't you just put more money in Apple?  ->","completion":" Yeah.   You've got $130 billion on the sitting around in cash.

Just the number of items on the ballot this time around on the proxy for ESG for other things they want to push the company to do push the board to do.  Um,  changes whether that be looking at climate change,  whether that be saying I'm not going to ever have anyone at the company have a political perspective that's made public.  I mean, those are things that, that have been a very important thing.  I mean, I think that Warren and Charlie both have been pretty disdainful of the idea that anybody else gets to force all the rest of the shareholders and the rest of the company what to do.  And that's fine because Warren and Charlie are in a position to be able to say those things.  I think the key is probably the shareholder base.  Are you convinced that the shareholder base will remain the same and second of all,  will they vote?  Will they actually go out and vote because retail investors in general don't vote on these things.  They just let it ride,  which is why you can have somebody get out of the way.  They get a small portion of the vote and have their way with it.   Well, the increasing percentage of ownership by some of the large index funds and so on.

Hi,  Warren and Chalice.  My name is James,  from Leisure.  Given the reason, challenged,  faced by the major US bank,  what is your overall  outlook on the banking industry?  How do you assess the risks and the opportunity in this section?  Well,  anticipating a few questions on banks,  I decided we should start using bank language here.  I'll describe to you.  And Charlie. ->","completion":" The situation in banking is,  is very similar to what it's always been in banking, that fear is contagious, always. And historically,  sometimes the fear was justified.  And sometimes it wasn't my dad lost his job in 1931 because of a bank run. And they had a bank run on state banks. And they had the online loan on national banks that were in the national bank and they didn't ever run on the national banks.  And of course, they both faced the same problem.  So it used to be that if you saw people lining up at a bank,  the proper response was to get into the line.  And you'd always leave it. And the story is that Sydney Wyberke of Goldman Sachs during one of the great bank runs, I get 90% of the bank runs.\n"}

In 1907 or thereabouts,  how do jobs are run or Goldman Sachs and asked if it was if he could take the week off. And it was said sure not much is going on anyway.  So he got in line that whether it was a liquor barker truster or wherever. And as he got toward the front of the line, he sold his place in line to somebody.  He didn't have an account of the bank,  but that was an asset.  And the banking system, the banking system has changed so much over the years.  And we did something enormously sensible in my view.  When we set up the FDIC,  as many as 2000 banks have failed in one year back after World War I.  I mean, bank runs were just part of the picture.  And if you have people that are worried about whether their money is safe in the bank and all fine would rise,  you can't run on the economy very well.  So, that's what I do.   The FDIC was very logical.  It's got changed over the years some.  ->","completion":" But here we are in,  you know, 2023.  And we actually see the FDIC pay off 100 cents on the dollar to everybody or make it available on all the men in the puzzles.

{"prompt":" I don't think the American public is that dumb.  And I just, well, I made that offer over in Tokyo incidentally that I haven't heard from anybody that wants to take up my million dollar bet on  whether the public will lose money.  And if  they have a demand deposit at a bank, no matter what the size.  So, that's the world we live in.  It means that a lot of magic can turn into a conflagration,  or it can be blown out.  And who knows what will happen?  And we don't have any worry.  We keep our money into cash and trades, you both at Berkshire, because we keep a hundred. 28 billion or whatever was at the end of the quarter. And we want to be there if the banking system temporarily even gets stalled in some way.  It shouldn't.  I don't think it will,  but I think it could.  And I think that the incentives in bank regulation are so messed up.  And so many people have an interest in having a messed up.  It's totally crazy.  I mean, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were doing 40 or so percent of the mortgage business in the United States.  That is huge.   They were regulated.   Just those two companies were regulated by some group,  I forget what they called, but they had 150 people that were in charge of just figuring out whether Freddie and Fannie were going to get it.  Right thing, but I could have done it.  Charlie could have done it.  ->","completion":" I'm not sure they needed an assistant even to do it,  but the incentives were all wrong.

The world goes on.   That is not a good lesson to teach people who are.   Holding the  behavior of the economy in their hands.  So I think there's some work to be done, but I don't think it's, it's not a difficult problem.  It's just we've screwed up the answer and we screwed up the communication of it.  Charlie.   Well, I'm so old fashioned that I kind of liked it better when banks didn't do investment banking.  That makes me very outmoded in the modern world.  And the country decided it was good.

You get too many in the picture and all of that sort of thing.  And what's happened?  The banks figured out a thousand different ways to get so you borrow on a hundred percent margin.

That's what that's what those Senate committees decided back in 1931 and 32.  And then in the late 1990s,  particularly, I mean, you know, very decent people, but you know, Bob Roman and some of the people,  you know, they they said, this is the modern world.  And here's what the modern world is turned out to hand us.  And I think that's what the last time we've done, and the late 1990s, particularly, I mean, you know, very decent people, but you know, Bob Roman and some of the people, you know, they said,  this is the modern world. And here's what the modern world is turned out to hand us and banking banking can have all kinds of of new inventions.  But it needs to have old values. And well, if we don't have that,  we don't have that good economy,  but we can't be able to have that kind of economy in that kind of way.  And the way that we have that kind of economy in the world.  Well, if we don't know what's going to happen,  you know, because there are a lot of things that could happen out of the present situation.   Depositors will not lose money.   Stockholders and deadholders of the holding company,  no, they should lose money. And the people borrowed on commercial real estate. And now it isn't the loans aren't getting extended. ->","completion":" They should leave too bad. \n"}
{"prompt":" This  question comes from Davis Hanson in Houston, Texas.  He writes, what do you think about the business models of the big banks as compared to the regional banks in the wake of the events at Silicon Valley Bank?  And how does the perceived implicit guarantee of all deposits at all banks affect big banks and those regional banks?   Yeah, well,  I can  say this.  If you follow sound banking methods,  which means you're not doing something else, I mean, you're not doing some things that other people do.  Bank could be a perfectly decent investment.  In fact, Charlie and I was me originally in 1969.  We bought a bank at Berkshire and we had $19 million invested in that bank.  And we had $17 million,  I think, invested in our insurance companies.  And if the banking holding company act of 1970 hadn't been passed,  we might have ended up owning a lot of banks instead of a lot of insurance companies.   We were looking at more banks and Harry Keith was taking us around Chicago and there were other things we could do.  And then bingo, they passed the 1970 bank holding company act and we had to divest ourselves of that bank in 10 years, which, by the way, it never had a bad death.  It never had an unnecessary cost.  It made nothing but money with no risk.  It never presented any deposit insurance risk to the government.  Zero.   It was a lovely sound.  Constructive institution in this community and any person who already deserved credit could get credit.  And we were going to buy more banks.  We were forced out of it.  And we were going to buy more banks. And if we bought more banks, we probably wouldn't have expanded the insurance business.  But, you know, the law changed and so we divested and we've done all kind of insurance. ->","completion":" But banking was more attractive to us. \n"}
{"prompt":" You've got a whole lot of people don't really understand how the system works.  And I would say that you've had something less than a perfect communication between various people and the American public.  So the American public is probably as confused about banking as ever.  And that has consequences.  And nobody knows what the consequences are because every event starts recreating a different dynamic.  I mean, in physics, you know that Pi is going to be 3.14,  you know, infinite number of numbers after that.  But no matter what happens,  but you don't know what has happened to the stickiness of deposits.  So all they got changed by 2008.   It's gotten changed by this.  And that changes everything. And so we're very cautious in a situation like that about ownership of banks. And we do remain with one bank holding a deal.  But we originated that deal.  And with the Bank of America,  and I like Bank of America,  I like the bank.  I like the management and I propose the deal with them.   So I stick with it.   But do I know how to project out what's going to happen for me?  The answer is I don't because I've seen so many things in the last few months,  which really weren't that unexpected to me to see,  but which reconfirm, I believe, that the American public doesn't understand their banking system.  And some people in Congress perhaps don't understand it anymore.  I don't understand what the spaceships go up.  ->","completion":" I mean, there's all kinds of things I don't know about. \n"}

{"prompt":" Station three.   Mr.  Buffett and Mr.  Munger.  Hi,  my name is Daphne.  I'm 13 years old,  and this is my six annual Berkshire halfway ten shoulders meeting.  And I've had the privilege of being here.  I've had the privilege to ask you both questions in years past.  My question for you today is the following.  As you know,  the US national debt is currently at an estimated $31 trillion,  making up about 125% of the US GDP.  In the meantime,  over the past few years,  the Federal Reserve has telegraphed that they intend to monetize the debt by printing trillions of dollars.  Even as they insist that they're fighting in fact,  they're going to be able to do it.  And I'm going to ask you about the inflation.  Already other major economies in the world, such as China,  Saudi Arabia,  and Brazil are moving away from the dollar and anticipation of this.  My question is,  are we likely to face a time in the future when the US dollar is no longer the global reserve currency?  How is Berkshire prepared for this possibility?  And what can we do as American citizens to attempt to shelter ourselves from what's beginning to look like?  The beginnings of the dollarization?  Well,  I should ask you to come up here and answer some questions.  It's very interesting.  I mean,  we are the reserve currency.  I see no option for any other currency to be the reserve currency. And I think that I'm sure you're not going to be able to do that.  Nobody understands the situation better than Jay Powell.  But he's not in control of fiscal policy.  And every now and then he drops a few hints.  And there was no question that when the pandemic broke out,  I mean, it was a semi-warlike situation.  But nobody knows what's going on.  Nobody knows how far you can go with the paper currency before it gets out of control.  And particularly if you're the world's reserve currency, nobody knows the answer to that. And you don't want to try and pick out the point that it does become a problem because then it's all over. And I think we should be very careful.  I mean, you know, we all learned that we're going to be able to do that.   You know, we all learned Keynesianism and we applied in World War II to the advantage of the country.  And we did everything.  We could to prevent inflation during the war and then war ended in August of 45.  And I think in January,  46, and I'm not giving you exact figures at all now,  but in January, 46, I think the rate of inflation was at something like 1% or thereabouts.  And by the end of the year,  I think it was at like 15% and again, I'm.  Doing this from long memories, but it's easy for America to do us a lot. ->","completion":" But if we do too much,  it's very hard to see how you recover once you let the genie out of the bottle and people lose faith in the currency.  And they'd be.  They behave in an entirely different manner than they do when they feel that they put someone in the bank or have a pension plan or whatever it may be that they're going to get out of something with roughly equal purchasing power.  And it just changes the economy and all kinds of things can happen then. And I can't predict them and nobody else can predict.\n"}

It's very interesting.  In Iowa,  we have actually produced more wind energy than is used.  The total amount of energy used by our customers,  but it's not produced about 24 hours a day necessarily.

I think no matter how things turn out, you know, the 15% tax doesn't bother me in the least and we can figure ways once we know the rules where we will pay the 15% tax.  And, you know, we were paying 52% tax,  the federal income taxes one.  I bought control in the partnership.  Up Berkshire Hathaway, I mean the tax rate come down dramatically and the deferred tax that was embodied,  for example, a Sanborn map when I was involved in a system that was allowed under the tax law to avoid that tax.  But that was a huge tax,  52%.  So we, we will live with this tax code and we do not think corporations are overtaxed in the United States.  And, uh,  you know, and I think that conversation about how we lose out to the world and all of this sort of thing is really nonsense.   Uh,  but,  uh, we've got, we've got a new law that hasn't yet the regulations haven't been written on.  And when, when we know what the game is, we will absolutely figure out a way to paying 15% every year and which generally we've been paying any more.  And, as I, I pointed out,  if there were a thousand corporations in the United States that paid what Berkshire has been paying,  nobody else in the United States, no individual, no corporation, whatever pay any income tax,  Social Security tax, gift tax, or state tax, anything else.  A thousand like Berkshire Hathaway would produce the revenue that's being produced by the federal government that's being derived into the present tax code from everybody in the United States.

So for me the most compelling takeaway from Berkshire is your guys emphasis on and successful use of properly aligned incentives.  In my view owning and leading a business has two central benefits first you directly benefit as the company goes through your.

Even though you say Berkshire gives us managers significant flexibility it must be less than what they have when they were independent.

It tells you a lot of things.  We show it on our balance sheet. \n"}

Recently, Mr.  Buffett has argued that holds a maturity accounting used by the banks to avoid reflecting the changes in fair value of bank investment portfolios in the income statement and the shareholder equity account do a disservice to its various stakeholders.  Can Mr.  Buffett elaborate on why he views market-to-market accounting differently for banks in comparison to Berkshire?  I believe in both cases,  in doing it on the balance sheet and not in the income statement.  It's a very tough problem with the auditor's face,  is that obviously the income statement feeds into the balance sheet.  The balance sheet tells you whether deposits can be paid.  It tells you a lot of things.  We show it on our balance sheet.   We believe in showing market values on our own.  We just don't believe in running it through the income account.  ->","completion":" In getting there, we would put it in other comprehensive income like it was for a long time. \n"}
{"prompt":" We believe in showing market values on our own.  We just don't believe in running it through the income account.   In getting there, we would put it in other comprehensive income like it was for a long time.   I sympathize to some extent with the,  for our extent, with the audit group,  but they have to really decide whether they want the balance sheet to represent values,  except it doesn't reflect them on the upside.  If we buy a balance sheet,  we'll have to do it.  Buy a seized can and it's worth way more money.  ->","completion":" So it's conservative in that sense. \n"}
{"prompt":" Or  whether they want to have an income account that becomes meaningless to people because it really changes every five seconds.  While we're in the markets close today, but we have days.  Well,  I guess Apple was up what,  some right point, some on Friday.  I mean, that's seven billion.   I mean, that's a crazy income account.   It is a reflection of where we stand at that point.  And of course, if you're a bank,  where you're putting out money, really, and things that people sort of mortgages, I mean, primarily.  They're a terrible instrument for a bank to own,  but a great instrument for a  consumer to buy and build in the whole society now in a way that was entitled.  It's entirely different than the past.  You've got to pay attention to whether they've gotten out of whack in terms of what's the value, what they own, and what can be demanded out in tomorrow morning.  If we had all of them,  our money could be demanded from us tomorrow morning.  We'd have to behave a lot differently than Berkshire does. ->","completion":" I don't, I don't, I really think the way to do it is the way you recommend doing,  which is exactly what was being done until a few years ago.  I recommend the shareholders look at it that way,  but we're going to follow the rules, obviously, the SEC.\n"}

The accounts did it just because they had a wild moment.  20, 25 years ago, I suggested to the audit profession that they just.  That the audit committee asked, auditors for questions and the shareholders would know a lot more about the company if those questions were asked.

Although there's a $250,000 limit on FDIC, the FDIC and the U. S. government and the American  public have no interest in having a bank fail and have deposits actually lost by people A lot of things that could happen out of the present situation, depositors will not lose  money, stockholders and debt holders of the holding company and all that, they should. lose money And if people borrow out on commercial real estate, and now it isn't, the loans aren't. getting extended, they should leave It's too bad.\n"}

I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that is going into artificial intelligence. I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well It can do all kinds of things, and when something can do all kinds of things, I get a little. bit worried, because I know we won't be able to un-invent it There's been some tension in the economic relationship of the United States and China. I think that tension has been wrongly created on both sides. I think we're equally guilty of being stupid. There's one thing we should do, it's get along with China, and we should have a lot of free  trade with China, in our mutual interest, and I just can't imagine. It's just so obvious There's so much safety and so much creativity that's possible. Think of what Apple has done by engaging in a partnership with China as a big supplier. It's been good for Apple and good for China. That's the kind of business we ought to be doing with China, and more of it.
