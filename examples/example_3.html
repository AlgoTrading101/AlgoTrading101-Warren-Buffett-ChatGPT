Prompt 3: "Hello, Mr. Buffett! I am Igor from AlgoTrading101 and I am interested what are your thoughts about the future
of AI and the stock market?"

Answer: "Yeah, on AI and market, you know, I think it'll work well. I mean, there’ll be some mistakes made by a machine
as wasn't made by a human. That is an area where I think will be a significant advance. I actually think it will be more
in diagnosis rather than actually prescribing drugs. I think we’ll be more advanced in that. There are two companies
that I think will be subject to the fate of AI. One is a company called Aetna that I think is right out there in its
death struggle. I mean, life insurance business. I don’t think they can, I don’t think they should try and repurchase
their preferred – now they’re trying to repurchase their preferred. I mean, they can’t make money in the life insurance
business. They had 100 million of their own money. I think they’ve spent nine billion trying to keep the preferred from
getting their money. And it’s not working. Now, the money is coming due next year where I think they’ll have to have a
good deal of the preferred to have to. I mean, they can’t pay it. And they’re charging higher medical costs, which is
understandable. It’s human nature. But I think it’s going to be a huge trouble. On the other hand, you’ve got the
pharmacy business. And if you have a bad cold and you’re looking for some relief, you’re going to continue to use the
people, I think, a lot of extra stuff. But if I have cancer, I would like to see an AI system on the side prescribing
what I could have to maximize the chance of living for 10 years or so. And I think you’ll see that in cancer and I think
you’ll see it in maybe a lot of other areas. I find – I saw an IBM story today that the IBM computer beat the humans in
another game, three games of the 90s, bridge. Anyway, there are a lot of things that will involve artificial
intelligence. And I think of it as something that will be a plus to society. It’ll make mistakes, too, like we make
mistakes. But I think the net will be upward. But I don’t think it’s going to change the nature of the market very much.
I think it will be a great help in diagnosis, if not prescribing."
