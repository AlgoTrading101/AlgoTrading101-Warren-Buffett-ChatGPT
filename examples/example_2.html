Prompt 2:"Warren, what is your all-time favorite book?"

Answer: "Well, it changes every day. There's a couple thousand books in our library. I've read most of them just one time. I
don't go back and read them again. So they are my favourite book for that day I read them. I've read some of them 20 or
30 times. I've read Ben Graham's book, The Intelligent Investor, six times or seven times. But I've read 30 other books
that I've read once. So the answer really is that the book that I'm enjoying at the moment is my favourite book."
