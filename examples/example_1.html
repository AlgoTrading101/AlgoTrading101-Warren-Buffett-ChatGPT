Prompt 1: "Income inequality, wealth inequality, you've talked about the earned income tax credit. Is there more to it
than that? Should we adjust tax policy? It seems to be going the other way right now."

Answer: "Well, we should adjust tax policy to get the income inequality to improve, not to deteriorate. And that means
making sure that we have a very progressive income tax. A lot of people have been fooled by the fact that the payroll
tax, which was originally designed to pay for Social Security and Medicare, has a regressive feature to it, that the
first $127,000 of income is not taxed. And then above that, it's taxed at a higher rate. And that's consistent with the
idea that you want to have some funding for Social Security and Medicare, and it doesn't burden lower-income people as
much as higher-income people. But I would like to see us move to a progressive income tax where the rate did get higher.
Today, it turns out it's about a third, effectively, as high on a billionaire as it is on somebody making $200,000,
because of all the deductions. And we shouldn't have a tax system encouraging people to get into the sort of artificial
economy, where you move to Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, where you make all your money, but you don't live in the
United States. I mean, it's crazy. And by the way, I should mention that in the 1930s, during the Roosevelt
administration, the maximum rate on the very top income was around 90 percent. And actually, under Dwight D. Eisenhower,
it was 93 percent. But I think it gets back to what you mentioned earlier, which is that you can do a lot to improve a
lot of things by having enough money available. And you can do things that are worthwhile, but they're not the highest
priority. You see the schools going down because the property tax system doesn't provide the money, and people don't
want to raise the property tax rates. So what do you get? You've got a choice of supporting the schools at a lower level
or even cutting them back further. And that's going to affect a lot of people. A real bust in terms of the schools is
going to affect a lot of people. And I think that the economic consequences of that for this country could be enormous.
Yeah. And you know, it's funny. It reminds me of something that happened years and years ago. I was in Omaha, and the
wife and I were very early in our marriage, and I took her out to dinner somewhere. And we sat across from each other at
the table. And she ordered the shrimp and the baked potato, and I ordered the steak and the baked potato, and all of a
sudden, she started crying. And I said, what's the matter? And she said I'm on the wrong side of the plate. I think
that's going to prove to be a big problem long-term in the United States, is we're all on the wrong side of the plate.
The top one percent today gets 20 percent of all of the national income. And it's gone up enormously since the crash.
And it's going to cause a lot of trouble. And we want a society where people can rise, but we don't want a society where
people think they have no chance of rising. And I think it's a hugely important issue. And I'm glad to see the Democrats
addressing it. They have a wealth tax in their plan, which I completely agree with. But I would like to not have it get
to that level. If we start really penalizing that high wealth, we could lose a lot of those people. If they get to the
point where they say, you know, I'm going to move to another country, I'm going to give all my money away, I don't want
to live in that society. And it seems to me that insofar as we can keep that from happening as a society, we've done
something very good. Yeah. And we're going to get more from the crew and the board.
